**Question:**
Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'He eats 32 from the largest pizzas because 2 x 16 = <<2*16=32>>32', 'L2': 'He eats 16 from the small pizza because 2 x 8 = <<2*8=16>>16', 'L3': 'He eats 48 pieces because 32 + 16 = <<32+16=48>>48'}

**Question:**
Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'To the initial 2 pounds of jelly beans, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, bringing the weight to 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 pounds.', 'L2': 'Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the weight to 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 pounds.', 'L3': 'And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, to a final weight of 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 pounds.'}

**Question:**
In a truck, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats.  If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'If there were 26 pink hard hats and Carl took away 4 pink hard hats, the number of pink hard hats that remained is 26-4 = <<26-4=22>>22', 'L2': 'John also took away 6 pink hard hats, leaving 22-6 = <<22-6=16>>16 pink hard hats in the truck.', 'L3': 'If John also took twice as many green hard hats as pink hard hats, he took 2*6 = <<6*2=12>>12 green hard hats.', 'L4': 'The total number of green hard hats that remained in the truck is 15-12 = <<15-12=3>>3', 'L5': 'In the truck, after some are taken, there were 3 green hard hats + 16 pink hard hats = <<3+16=19>>19 hard hats in the truck.', 'L6': 'Altogether, 19 green and pink hard hats + 24 yellow hards hats = <<19+24=43>>43 hard hats remained in the truck'}

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'Roque takes 2*3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours a week to walk to work.', 'L2': 'Roque takes 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours a week to walk to and from work.', 'L3': 'Roque takes 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours a week to bike to work.', 'L4': 'Roque takes 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours a week to bike to and from work.', 'L5': 'In total, Roque takes 12+4 = <<12+4=16>>16 hour a week to go to and from work.'}

**Question:**
Bella bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Bella buy in all?

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'The number of truck stamps is 11 + 9 = <<11+9=20>>20.', 'L2': 'The number of rose stamps is 20 − 13 = <<20-13=7>>7.', 'L3': 'Bella bought 11 + 20 + 7 = <<11+20+7=38>>38 stamps in all.'}

**Question:**
Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'First find the total number of snakes eaten: 5 snakes/jaguar * 6 jaguars = <<5*6=30>>30 snakes', 'L2': 'Then find the total number of birds eaten per day: 30 snakes * 3 birds/snake = <<30*3=90>>90 snakes', 'L3': 'Then multiply the number of snakes by the number of beetles per snake to find the total number of beetles eaten per day: 90 snakes * 12 beetles/snake = <<90*12=1080>>1080 beetles'}

**Question:**
Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = <<4*2+2=10>>10 letters long.', 'L2': 'Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 letters in Samantha’s last name.'}

Mary does her grocery shopping on Saturday. She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. That week she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday. How much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'So far, Mary has paid back $15 +$23=$<<15+23=38>>38 of the credit.', 'L2': 'So she still needs to pay $100-$38=$<<100-38=62>>62'}

**Question:**
There are 5 houses on a street, and each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden. If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?

**Solution mapping:**
{'L1': 'In the first four houses, there are a total of 4 houses * 3 gnomes = <<4*3=12>>12 gnomes.', 'L2': 'Therefore, the fifth house had 20 total gnomes – 12 gnomes = <<20-12=8>>8 gnomes.'}
