On the fourth day, the library had 120 books - 20 - 25 - 30 = 45 books remaining.
The library can help 45 books / 5 books = 9 students on the fourth day.

5369,tier3,Matt has a peanut plantation that is 500 feet by 500 feet.  1 square foot of peanuts can make 50 grams of peanuts.  If it takes 20 grams of peanuts to make 5 grams of peanut butter and 1 kg of peanut butter sells for $10 how much does he make from his plantation?,"His plantation is 500*500=250000 square feet
That means he gets 250000*50=12500000 grams of peanuts
So he makes 12500000*5/20=3125000 grams of peanut butter
So he has 3125000/1000=3125 kg of peanut butter
That means it sells for 3125*10=$31250
