Question:
Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'There are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.', 'L2': "So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.", 'L3': 'Purple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.', 'L4': "That means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = <<25/100*28=7>>7 green flowers.", 'L5': 'So in total Mark has 28 + 7 = <<28+7=35>>35 plants in his garden.'}

Question:
Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'Let S be the amount Alexis paid for the shoes.', 'L2': 'She spent S + 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = S + <<+30+46+38+11+18=143>>143.', 'L3': 'She used all but $16 of her budget, so S + 143 = 200 - 16 = 184.', 'L4': 'Thus, Alexis paid S = 184 - 143 = $<<184-143=41>>41 for the shoes.'}

Question:
Leah earned $28 working odd jobs around the neighborhood. She spent a seventh of it on a milkshake and put half of the rest in her savings account. She left the remaining money in her wallet. Her dog got ahold of her wallet and shredded all the money inside but $1. How many dollars did Leah lose?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'Leah spent 28 / 7 = $<<28/7=4>>4 on a milkshake.', 'L2': 'She had 28 - 4 = $<<28-4=24>>24 left.', 'L3': 'She put half in her savings account and half in her wallet, so she had 24 / 2 = $<<24/2=12>>12 in her wallet.', 'L4': 'Her dog shredded all the money in her wallet but $1, so Leah lost 12 - 1 = $<<12-1=11>>11.'}

Question:
Nancy is filling an aquarium for her fish. She fills it halfway and goes to answer the door. While she's gone, her cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water in it. Then Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. If the aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high, how many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'First calculate the volume of the aquarium by multiplying its length, width and height: 4 ft * 6 ft * 3 ft = <<4*6*3=72>>72 cubic ft', 'L2': 'Then figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after the cat knocks it over: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4', 'L3': 'Then figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after Nancy refills it: 3 * 1/4 = 3/4', 'L4': "Now multiply the proportion of the aquarium that's full by the aquarium's volume to find out how much water is in it: 72 cubic ft * 3/4 = <<72*3/4=54>>54 cubic ft"}

Question:
Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = <<25*8=200>>200 hours', 'L2': 'Then calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15/hour = $<<200*15=3000>>3000', 'L3': 'Then multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $<<3000*4=12000>>12,000', 'L4': 'Now multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20/hour = $<<200*20=4000>>4,000', 'L5': "Now multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4,000/manager * 2 managers = $<<4000*2=8000>>8,000", 'L6': 'Now add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8,000 + $12,000 = $<<8000+12000=20000>>20,000', 'L7': 'Now multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $20,000 * .1 = $<<20000*.1=2000>>2,000', 'L8': 'Now add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $2,000 + $20,000 = $<<2000+20000=22000>>22,000'}

Question:
Alec is running for Class President. He thinks that if he can get three-quarters of the class to vote for him then there is no chance anyone else can beat him. Half of the class have already said they will vote for him but out of the remaining students, only 5 have said they are thinking about voting for him. He surveys the students who are thinking about voting for someone else, and changes his flyers to reflect the issues these students are concerned about. This results in a fifth of these students saying they'll vote for him. If Alec's class has 60 students and everyone who said they will vote for him does so, how many more votes does Alec need to reach his goal number of votes?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': "To calculate Alec's goal number of votes, we need to know that 60 students / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 students is equal to one-quarter of the class students.", 'L2': "Alec's goal is therefore 15 students * 3 quarters = <<15*3=45>>45 votes.", 'L3': 'Half of the class said they will vote for him, so there are already 60 students / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 votes.', 'L4': 'Another 5 students are thinking about voting for him which leaves a total so far of 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 votes.', 'L5': 'This means there are 60 students - 35 voting for Alec = <<60-35=25>>25 students not voting for Alec.', 'L6': 'A fifth of these decided to vote, so this is a further 25 students / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5 votes.', 'L7': 'Alec is therefore receiving a total of 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 votes.', 'L8': 'So he has missed his goal by 45 goal votes - 40 actual votes = <<45-40=5>>5 votes.'}

Question:
Karen's students are about to take a standardized test. Karen gets a $500 bonus if their average score is above 75, plus an extra $10 bonus for every additional point the average score increases above 75. So far, Karen has graded 8 tests, and the average is 70. Given that each student can have a maximum score of 150, what combined score do the last two tests need to have for Karen to earn a $600 bonus?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': "First subtract $500 from Karen's goal bonus amount to find how much she makes from the extra $10/point bonus: $600 - $500 = $<<600-500=100>>100", 'L2': 'Then divide the extra bonus by the extra rate: $100 / $10/point = <<100/10=10>>10 points', 'L3': "Then add the 10 extra points to the baseline 75 point goal to find the students' average test score: 10 points + 75 points = <<10+75=85>>85 points", 'L4': 'Then added the 8 graded tests to the 2 ungraded tests to find the total number of tests: 2 tests + 8 tests = <<2+8=10>>10 tests', 'L5': 'Then multiply the 85 point average by the number of tests to find the total number of points the students need to earn: 85 points/test * 10 tests = 850 points', 'L6': 'Then multiply the current average by the current number of graded tests to find how many points have been earned so far: 70 points/test * 8 tests = <<70*8=560>>560 points', 'L7': 'Then subtract the number of points earned from the number of points needed to find the combine score the last two tests need: 850 points - 560 points = <<850-560=290>>290 points'}
