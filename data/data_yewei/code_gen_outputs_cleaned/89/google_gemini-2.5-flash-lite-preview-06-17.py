# Calculate the increase in books borrowed on Friday
friday_increase = 40 * 0.40

# Calculate the total books borrowed from Monday to Thursday
# Assuming the average of 40 books applies to these days
books_mon_thu = 4 * 40

# Calculate the total books borrowed in a week (Monday to Friday)
total_books_week = books_mon_thu + (40 + friday_increase)

# Print the result
