# Calculate the total earnings from selling crafts
crafts_sold = 3
price_per_craft = 12
earnings_from_crafts = crafts_sold * price_per_craft

# Add the extra money received from the customer
extra_money = 7
total_earnings = earnings_from_crafts + extra_money

# Subtract the amount deposited into the bank
deposit_amount = 18
remaining_money = total_earnings - deposit_amount

# Print the final result
