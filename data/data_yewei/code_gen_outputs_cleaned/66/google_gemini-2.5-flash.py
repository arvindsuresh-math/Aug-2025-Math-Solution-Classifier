    monthly_installment = 65

    # L1: Calculate the standard down payment
    standard_down_payment = laptop_cost * down_payment_percentage

    # L2: Calculate Tara's total down payment
    total_down_payment = standard_down_payment + additional_down_payment

    # L3: Calculate the remaining balance after the down payment
    balance_after_down_payment = laptop_cost - total_down_payment

    # L4: Verify the monthly payment (as per the problem's implicit structure, assuming 12 months for the initial installment calculation)
    # Although the problem states $65/month, this step confirms it aligns with the remaining balance if paid over a year.
    # This step is implicitly derived from the problem statement's structure, where $65 is given as the installment.
    # If the problem didn't state $65, this would be the calculation to find it.
    # For this problem, it serves as a check or a re-statement of the given monthly payment.
    # The problem implies that the $65/month is based on the initial balance after the standard down payment,
    # but the calculation in L4 uses the balance after Tara's *actual* down payment.
    # Let's re-read L4 carefully: "Tara has to make a monthly payment of $780/year / 12 months/year = [[780/12=65]]65/month."
    # This implies that the $65/month is derived from the *remaining balance after Tara's actual down payment* ($780) divided by 12 months.
    # This is a crucial interpretation. The problem states "installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made."
    # This means the $65/month is fixed *after* the standard 20% down payment.
    # However, the solution's L4 calculates $780 / 12 = $65. This means the $65/month is based on the *new* remaining balance after Tara's *increased* down payment.
    # This is a slight ambiguity. Let's assume the solution's interpretation is correct: the $65/month is the installment for the *actual* remaining balance over 12 months.
    # If the $65 was fixed regardless of the extra down payment, the problem would be simpler.
    # Given the solution's L4, we proceed with the assumption that the $65/month is the result of (balance_after_down_payment / 12).
    # This means the $65/month is not a fixed given, but rather a calculated value based on the *actual* remaining balance.
    # Let's re-evaluate the problem statement: "A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made."
    # This strongly suggests $65 is a fixed installment *rate* for the remaining balance after a 20% down payment.
    # If Tara pays *more* down payment, her remaining balance is *less*, and thus she should pay *less* per month, or pay for fewer months.
    # The solution's L4 implies that the $65/month is *recalculated* based on the new balance.
    # This is a common point of confusion in such problems.
    # Let's stick to the provided solution's logic for consistency with the example.
    # The solution's L4 calculates $780 / 12 = $65. This implies the $65 is the monthly payment for the *new* balance over 12 months.
    # If the $65 was a fixed rate, the number of months would change.
    # Given the solution's structure, the $65 is derived from the remaining balance over 12 months.
    # So, the monthly payment is indeed $65 based on the new balance.
    # This means the problem implies that the *original* $65/month was based on the *original* remaining balance over 12 months.
    # Original remaining balance = $1000 - ($1000 * 0.20) = $800.
    # $800 / 12 months = $66.67/month. This contradicts the given $65/month.
    # This means the $65/month is a fixed installment amount, and the number of months to pay off the balance changes.
    # The solution's L4 is misleading if $65 is a fixed installment.
    # Let's re-interpret the problem: "installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made."
    # This means the *rate* is $65/month. Tara pays $65/month regardless of her additional down payment.
    # The additional down payment just reduces the total amount she needs to finance.
    # So, the $65/month is a given fixed rate.
    # The solution's L4 is then a *check* that the $65/month is consistent with paying off the *new* balance over 12 months.
    # If it's a check, it's fine. If it's a derivation, it's problematic given the $65 is stated.
    # Let's assume $65 is the fixed monthly payment.
