```python
# Calculate the total number of pencils Arnel shared with his friends.
pencils_shared_with_friends = 5 * 8

# Calculate the total number of pencils Arnel had initially.
total_pencils = pencils_shared_with_friends + 10

# Calculate the number of pencils in each box.
pencils_per_box = total_pencils / 10

# Print the result
