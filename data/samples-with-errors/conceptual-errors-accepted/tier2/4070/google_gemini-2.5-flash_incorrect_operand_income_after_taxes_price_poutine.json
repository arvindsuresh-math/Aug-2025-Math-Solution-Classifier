    "flawed_solution": "#### 62\nHe earns $12 + $8 = $<<12+8=20>>20 after selling the French fries and Poutine every day.\nSo, he earns $20 x 7 = $<<20*7=140>>140 every week.\nAnd the total amount he pays for the taxes is $140 x 0.1= $<<140*0.1=14>>14.\nSo, his income after paying the weekly taxes is $140 - $8 = $<<140-8=132>>132.\nLucius spends $10 x 7 = $<<10*7=70>>70 for the ingredients every week.\nTherefore, his total income every week after buying all the ingredients and paying the taxes is $132 - $70 = $<<132-70=62>>62."
