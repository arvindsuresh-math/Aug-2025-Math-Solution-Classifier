    "flawed_solution": "#### 500\nThe second neighborhood uses 150 * 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 barrels of water.\nThe third neighborhood uses 300 + 100 = <<300+100=400>>400 barrels of water.\nThe first, second, and third neighborhoods together use 300 + 400 = <<300+400=700>>700 barrels of water.\nThus, the fourth neighborhood has 1200 - 700 = <<1200-700=500>>500 barrels of water left for it to use."
