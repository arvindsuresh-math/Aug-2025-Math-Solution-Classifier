    "flawed_solution": "#### 4\nJacob can eat 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 candies before crying.\nLana can eat 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 candies before crying.\nNellie and Jacob ate until they cried, so they ate 12 + 6 = <<12+6=18>>18 candies.\nThus, there are 30 - 18 = <<30-18=12>>12 candies left in the bucket.\nAfter dividing the remaining candies equally, they will each get 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 sourball candies."
