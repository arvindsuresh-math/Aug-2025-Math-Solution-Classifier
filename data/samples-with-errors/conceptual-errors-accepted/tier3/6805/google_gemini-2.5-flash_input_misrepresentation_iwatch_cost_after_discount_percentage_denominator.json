    "flawed_solution": "#### 735\nThe discount for an iPhone 12 is $800 x 15/100 = $<<800*15/100=120>>120.\nSo, the iPhone will now cost $800 - $120 = $<<800-120=680>>680.\nThe discount for an iWatch is $300 x 10/100 = $<<300*10/100=30>>30.\nSo, the iWatch will now cost $100 - $30 = $<<100-30=70>>70.\nThe total cost of the iPhone and iWatch is $680 + $70 = $<<680+70=750>>750.\nThe cashback will be $750 x 2/100 = $<<750*2/100=15>>15.\nThus, Dexter will only pay $750 - $15 = $<<750-15=735>>735."
