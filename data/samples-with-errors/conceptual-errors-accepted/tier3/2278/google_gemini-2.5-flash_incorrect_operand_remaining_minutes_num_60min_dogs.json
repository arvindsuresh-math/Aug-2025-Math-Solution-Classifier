    "flawed_solution": "#### 3300\nJohnny spends 6/3=2 hours walking the 6 dogs who have 60-minute walks.\nHe makes $20*6=$<<20*6=120>>120 for these walks.\nThus, he has 4-2=6 hours=360 minutes left to walk the other dogs.\nHe can walk 3*(360/30)=<<3*(360/30)=36>>36 dogs in this time.\nThus, he will make $15*36=$<<36*15=540>>540 on these walks.\nIn total per day, he makes $120+$540=$<<120+540=660>>660 per day.\nThus, during the week, he makes $660*5=$<<660*5=3300>>3300."
