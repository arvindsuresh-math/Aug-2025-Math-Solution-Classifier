    "question": "N/A",
    "flawed_solution": "#### 66\nStarting with the bonus, Maurice would receive it 30 / 15 = <<30/15=2>>2 times.\nThis means the bonus money, would make up to 2 * 6 = $<<2*6=12>>12.\nMaurice would do 30 tasks, so for all of them, he would receive 30 * 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.\nSo in total Maurice would make 60 + 12 = $<<60+12=72>>72 for finishing 30 tasks."
