    "flawed_solution": "#### 400/3\nTraveling 20 hours due east at 20 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*20=<<20*20=400>>400 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 400 kilometers, then 2*400=<<2*400=800>>800 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 800 = <<800/3=800/3>>800/3 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 400 - 800/3 = <<400-800/3=400/3>>400/3 kilometers."
