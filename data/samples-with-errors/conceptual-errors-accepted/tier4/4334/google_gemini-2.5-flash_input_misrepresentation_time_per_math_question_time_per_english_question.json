    "flawed_solution": "#### 43\nJoan is given 1 x 60 = <<1*60=60>>60 minutes to answer the English exam.\nSo Joan will spend 60/30 = <<60/30=2>>2 minutes for each English question.\nShe is given 1.5 x 60 = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes to answer the Math exam.\nSo, she will spend 90/18 = <<90/18=5>>5 minutes for each Math question.\nHence, Joan has 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 minutes more for answering each question in Math than in English."
