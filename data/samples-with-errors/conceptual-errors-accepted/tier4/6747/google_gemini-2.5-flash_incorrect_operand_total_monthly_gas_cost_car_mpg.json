    "flawed_solution": "#### 15\nFirst find the total number of monthly commutes: 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<5*4=20>>20 days/month\nThen multiply the distance of the commute one way by the two ways: 21 miles * 2 = <<21*2=42>>42 miles\nThen multiply the number of commutes by the number of miles per commute: 42 miles/commute * 20 commutes = <<42*20=840>>840 miles\nThen divide the number of miles by the car's gas mileage: 840 miles / 30 miles/gallon = <<840/30=28>>28 gallons\nThen multiply that number by the cost of each gallon to find the total cost: 30 gallons * $2.5/gallon = $<<30*2.5=75>>75\nThen divide the total cost by the number of friends to find the cost per person: $75 / 5 people = $<<75/5=15>>15/person"
