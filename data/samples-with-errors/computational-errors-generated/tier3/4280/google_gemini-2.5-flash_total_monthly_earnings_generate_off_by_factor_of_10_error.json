  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $<<133/7=19>>19.\nThe total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $<<19*100=19000>>19000 is her monthly earnings.\nSo, $19000/2 = $<<19000/2=9500>>9500 is spent on her other monthly expenses.\nThe total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $9500 = $<<133+9500=9633>>9633.\nHence, she saves $19000 - $9633 = $<<19000-9633=9367>>9367 per month.\n#### 9367",
