  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the weight of 20 cans is 20 cans * 2 oz per can = <<20*2=40>>40 oz.\nThus, Jenny has the capacity to carry 100 oz - 40 oz = <<100-40=60>>60 oz of bottles.\nJenny can carry 60 oz / 6 oz per bottle = <<60/6=10>>10 bottles.\nJenny earns 10 bottles * 10 cents per bottle = <<10*10=10>>10 cents for the bottles.\nJenny earns 20 cans * 3 cents per can = <<20*3=60>>60 cents for the cans.\nIn total, she earns 10 cents + 60 cents = <<10+60=70>>70 cents.\n#### 70",
