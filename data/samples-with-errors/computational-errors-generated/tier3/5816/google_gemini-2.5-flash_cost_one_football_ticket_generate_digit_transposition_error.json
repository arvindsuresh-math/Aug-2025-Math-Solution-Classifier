  "flawed_nl_solution": "If each movie ticket is sold at $30, the cost of buying eight movie tickets is 8*$30 = $240<<8*30=240>>240\nSince eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of buying one football game ticket is $240/2 = $102<<240/2=102>>102\nBuying 5 football game tickets will cost 5*$102 = $510<<5*102=510>>510\nThe total cost of buying eight movie tickets and five football game tickets is $510+$240 = $750\n#### 750",
