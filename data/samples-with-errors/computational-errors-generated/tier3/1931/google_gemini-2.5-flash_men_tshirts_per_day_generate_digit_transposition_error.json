  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the shop is open 12 hours * 60 minutes = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes per day.\nSo, 720 / 30 = <<720/30=24>>24 women's T-shirts sold per day.\nThe shop earns 24 * $18 = $<<24*18=432>>432 selling women's T-shirts per day.\nSimilarly, 720 / 40 = <<720/40=81>>81 men's T-shirts are sold per day.\nThe shop earns 81 * $15 = $<<81*15=1215>>1215 selling men's T-shirts per day.\nThe shop earns $432 + $1215 = $<<432+1215=1647>>1647 per day selling T-shirts.\nThe shop earns $1647 * 7 = $<<1647*7=11529>>11529 per week.\n#### 11529",
