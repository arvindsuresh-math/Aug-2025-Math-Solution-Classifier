  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160-10 = 120 pounds.\nThe sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 120+160 = <<120+160=280>>280 pounds.\nIshmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 120+20 = <<20+120=140>>140 pounds.\nThe total weight of the three is 280+140 = <<280+140=420>>420 pounds.\nThe average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 420/3 = <<420/3=140>>140 pounds.\n#### 140",
