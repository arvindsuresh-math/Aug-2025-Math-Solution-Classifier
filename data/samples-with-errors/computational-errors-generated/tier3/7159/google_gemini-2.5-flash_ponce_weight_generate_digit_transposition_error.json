  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160-10 = 510 pounds.\nThe sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 510+160 = <<510+160=670>>670 pounds.\nIshmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 510+20 = <<20+510=530>>530 pounds.\nThe total weight of the three is 670+530 = <<670+530=1200>>1200 pounds.\nThe average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 1200/3 = <<1200/3=400>>400 pounds.\n#### 400",
