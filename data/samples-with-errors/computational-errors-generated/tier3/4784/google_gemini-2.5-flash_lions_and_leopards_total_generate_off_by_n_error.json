  "flawed_nl_solution": "If there are 200 lions in the park, which is twice the number of leopards in the park, there are 200/2 = <<200/2=100>>100 leopards in the park.\nThe total population of lions and leopards in the park is 200 lions + 100 leopards = <<200+100=304>>304\nThe number of elephants in the park is 1/2 the total population of lions and leopards; thus, there are 304/2 = <<304/2=152>>152 elephants in the park.\nThere are a total of 152+304 = <<152+304=456>>456 animals in the park.\n#### 456",
