  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 20 x 1/2 = <<20*1/2=40/1>>40/1 red roses in each row.\nSo there are 20 - 40/1 = <<20-40/1=-20>>-20 roses that are not red in each row.\nOut of the -20 remaining roses in each row, -20 x 3/5 = <<-20*3/5=-12>>-12 roses are white.\nThus, there are -20 - -12 = <<-20--12=-8>>-8 pink roses in each row.\nTherefore, Mrs. Dawson has -8 pink roses each in 10 rows for a total of -8 x 10 = <<-8*10=-80>>-80 pink roses in her rose garden.\n#### -80",
