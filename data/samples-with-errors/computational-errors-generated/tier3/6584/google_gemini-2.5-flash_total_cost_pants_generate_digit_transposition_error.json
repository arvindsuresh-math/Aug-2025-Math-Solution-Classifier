  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total cost of the four T-shirts is 4 x $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThree pairs of pants cost 3 x $80 = $<<3*80=420>>420.\nTwo pairs of shoes cost 2 x $150 = $<<2*150=300>>300.\nThe total amount of all the items is $80 + $420 + $300 = $<<80+420+300=800>>800.\nThus, Eugene will get a discount of 10/100 x $800 = $80. Therefore, Eugene will have to pay $800 - $80 = $<<800-80=720>>720.\n#### 720",
