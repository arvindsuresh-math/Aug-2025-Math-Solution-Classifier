  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total cost of the four T-shirts is 4 x $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThree pairs of pants cost 3 x $80 = $<<3*80=240>>240.\nTwo pairs of shoes cost 2 x $150 = $<<2*150=30>>30.\nThe total amount of all the items is $80 + $240 + $30 = $<<80+240+30=350>>350.\nThus, Eugene will get a discount of 10/100 x $350 = $35. Therefore, Eugene will have to pay $350 - $35 = $<<350-35=315>>315.\n#### 315",
