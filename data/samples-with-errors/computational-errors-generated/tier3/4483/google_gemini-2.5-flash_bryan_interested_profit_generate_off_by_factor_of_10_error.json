  "flawed_nl_solution": "Sammy is offering to take the whole collection of 200 records and pay Peggy 4 dollars each for them which would net Peggy 200 * 4=<<200*4=800>>800 dollars for her entire record collection.\nBryan is willing to buy Peggy's entire record collection but at two different price points, half at one point and half at another. Half of Peggy's record collection is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100, which means that 100 records will sell for one price and 100 records will sell for another price.\nBryan is willing to pay more for the half of the record collection that he is interested in so Peggy would net 100 * 6=<<100*6=60>>60 dollars for the first half of her record collection.\nFor the half of the collection that Bryan is just planning on reselling at a later date, he is willing to offer Peggy 100 *1=<<100*1=100>>100 dollars to take off of her hands.\nIn total Bryan is willing to offer Peggy 60+100=<<60+100=160>>160 dollars for her entire record collection.\nIf Sammy is offering 800 dollars to buy Peggy's entire record collection and Bryan is offering 160 dollars for Peggy's entire record collection, then Peggy's net profit would be 800-160=<<800-160=640>>640 dollars more by taking Sammy's deal instead of Bryan's deal.\n#### 640",
