  "flawed_nl_solution": "The price of a tub of ice cream is now $12 - $2 = $<<12-2=8>>8.\nSo the 2 tubs of ice cream amount to $8 x 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.\nThere are 10/5 = <<10/5=2>>2 sets of 5 cans of juice.\nThus, you will pay $2 x 2 = $4 for the 10 cans of juice.\nTherefore, you will pay a total of $16 + $4 = $<<16+4=20>>20.\n#### 20",
