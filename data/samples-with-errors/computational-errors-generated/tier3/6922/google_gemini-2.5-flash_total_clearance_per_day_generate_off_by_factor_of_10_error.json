  "flawed_nl_solution": "One square yard is the same as 3 feet by 3 feet, or 3*3=<<1*3*3=9>>9 square feet.\nTen square yards is 9*10=<<10*9=90>>90 square feet.\nTherefore, 100 rabbits can clear 100*90=<<100*90=900>>900 square feet of grassland per day.\nA 200 ft by 900 ft area is 200*900=<<200*900=180000>>180000 square feet.\nThus, 180000 sq ft can be cleared by 100 rabbits in 180000/900=<<180000/900=200>>200 days\n#### 200",
