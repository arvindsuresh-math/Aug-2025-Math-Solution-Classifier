  "flawed_nl_solution": "Three times as many cement bags is 3*80 = <<3*80=240>>240 cement bags.\nIf a bag of cement weighs 50 kg, 3/5 times as much weight is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 kgs.\nIf the cost of transporting 80 bags of cement, each weighing 50 kgs, is $6000, the cost of transporting one bag of cement weighing 50 kg is $6000/80 = $<<6000/80=75>>75\nSince a bag weighing 50 kgs costs $75 to transport, a bag weighing 30 kgs will cost 30* $75/50 = $<<30*75/50=54>>54 to transport.\nThe cost of transporting 240 cement bags each weighing 30 kgs is $54*240 = $<<54*240=12960>>12960\n#### 12960",
