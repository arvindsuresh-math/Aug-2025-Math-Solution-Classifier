  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, subtract the number of days Jenna can't read from the number of days in September: 30 days - 4 days = <<30-4=26>>26 days.\nThen subtract the one day when Jenna will read 100 pages: 26 days - 1 day = <<26-1=25>>25 days.\nNow subtract the 100 pages Jenna will read on her flight from her overall goal: 600 pages - 100 pages = <<600-100=5000>>5000 pages.\nFinally, divide that number of pages by the number of days Jenna will read the standard amount: 5000 pages / 25 days = <<5000/25=200>>200 pages per day.\n#### 200",
