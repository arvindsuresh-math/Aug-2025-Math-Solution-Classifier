  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, subtract the number of days Jenna can't read from the number of days in September: 30 days - 4 days = <<30-4=21>>21 days.\nThen subtract the one day when Jenna will read 100 pages: 21 days - 1 day = <<21-1=20>>20 days.\nNow subtract the 100 pages Jenna will read on her flight from her overall goal: 600 pages - 100 pages = <<600-100=500>>500 pages.\nFinally, divide that number of pages by the number of days Jenna will read the standard amount: 500 pages / 20 days = <<500/20=25>>25 pages per day.\n#### 25",
