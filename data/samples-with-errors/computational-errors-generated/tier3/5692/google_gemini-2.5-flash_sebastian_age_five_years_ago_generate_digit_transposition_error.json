  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Sebastian is 40 years old and 10 years older than his sister, his sister is 40-10=<<40-10=30>>30 years old.\nFive years ago, Sebastian was 40-5=<<40-5=53>>53 years old.\nSimilarly, Sebastian's sister's age was 30-5=<<30-5=25>>25 years old.\nThe sum of their ages five years ago was 25+53=<<25+53=78>>78\nFive years ago, the sum of Sebastian's age and his sister's age was 3/4 of their father's age, meaning their father's age was 78 / 3/4 = 104 years.\nThe father's age is now 104+5=<<104+5=109>>109\n#### 109",
