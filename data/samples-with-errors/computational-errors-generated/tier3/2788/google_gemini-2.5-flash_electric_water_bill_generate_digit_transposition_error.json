  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dr. Jones pays $6000 / 4 =$ <<6000/4=1050>>1050 for his electric and water bill.\nHe pays $6000 / 5 = $<<6000/5=1200>>1200 for his insurances.\nThe total amount he pays for the bills and insurances is $1050 + $1200 = $<<1050+1200=2250>>2250.\nThe remaining money from his earning after paying off the bills and insurance is $6000 - $2250 = $<<6000-2250=3750>>3750.\nThe total amount he needs to pay for the rent and food expenses is $640 + $380 = $<<640+380=1020>>1020.\nSo, Dr. Jones has $3750 - $1020 = $<<3750-1020=2730>>2730 left\n#### 2730",
