  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each of the 2 hoses delivers water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute, for a combined total of 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 gallons of water per minute.\nThe other 2 hoses each deliver water at a rate of 3 gallons per minute, for a combined total of 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 gallons of water per minute.\nThus, all four hoses deliver a combined total of 4+6=<<4+6=10>>10 gallons of water per minute.\nWith a volume of 15000 gallons, it would take 15000/10=<<15000/10=1500>>1500 minutes to fill the pool.\nConverting to hours, it will take 1500/60=<<1500/60=52>>52 hours to fill the pool.\n#### 52",
