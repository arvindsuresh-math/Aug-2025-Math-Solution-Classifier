  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine how many miles Tony drives in 4 weeks. We do this by performing 50*5=<<50*5=250>>250 miles per week.\nNext, we multiply the weekly total by 4 by performing 4*250= <<4*250=10000>>10000 miles in 4 weeks.\nNow, we need to find out how many times Tony needs to fill up his gas tank. His gas tank holds enough gas to last 25*10=<<25*10=250>>250 miles.\nThis means in 4 weeks, he needs to fill up his tank 10000/250= <<10000/250=40>>40 times.\nSince Tony's gas tank holds 10 gallons, this means he needs to pay for 40*10- 400 gallons of gas in a month.\nSince gas costs $2 a gallon, this means Tony spends 400*2=$800 on gas every month,\n#### 800",
