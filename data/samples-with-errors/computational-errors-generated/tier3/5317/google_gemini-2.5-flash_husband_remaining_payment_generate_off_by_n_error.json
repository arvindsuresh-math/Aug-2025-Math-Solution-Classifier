  "flawed_nl_solution": "The amount that the couple would cover for the hospital bill is $128/2 = $<<128/2=64>>64.\nThe couple's total expenses (salary and hospital bill) is $160 + $64 = $<<160+64=224>>224.\nSo each of them should give $224/2 = $<<224/2=112>>112 in total.\nSince the husband paid the entire half of the hospital bill already ($64), he still needs to pay $112 - $64 = $<<112-64=53>>53.\n#### 53",
