  "flawed_nl_solution": "The amount that the couple would cover for the hospital bill is $128/2 = $<<128/2=46>>46.\nThe couple's total expenses (salary and hospital bill) is $160 + $46 = $<<160+46=206>>206.\nSo each of them should give $206/2 = $<<206/2=103>>103 in total.\nSince the husband paid the entire half of the hospital bill already ($46), he still needs to pay $103 - $46 = $<<103-46=57>>57.\n#### 57",
