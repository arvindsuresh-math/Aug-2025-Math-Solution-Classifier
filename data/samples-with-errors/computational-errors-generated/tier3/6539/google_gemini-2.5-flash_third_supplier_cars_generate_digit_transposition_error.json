  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second supplier receives 1000000 + 500000 = 1500000 cars.\nThe third supplier receives 1000000 + 1500000 = 2050000 cars.\nSo the first to third suppliers receive a total of 1000000 + 1500000 + 2050000 = 4550000 cars.\nThus, 5650000 - 4550000 = 1100000 cars are left to be divided by the two other suppliers.\nTherefore, the fourth and fifth suppliers receive 1100000/2 = 550000 cars each.\n#### 550000",
