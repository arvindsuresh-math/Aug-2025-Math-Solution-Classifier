  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are two walls that are 12' X 10' and two walls that are 16' by 10'. First find the size in square feet of one 12' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 12 ft * 10 ft = <<12*10=120>>120 sq ft\nMultiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 12' x 10' walls: 120 sq ft * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 sq ft\nThen find the size in square feet of one 16' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 16 ft * 10 ft = <<16*10=160>>160 sq ft\nMultiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 16' x 10' walls: 160 sq ft * 2 = <<160*2=320>>320 sq ft\nNow add the square footage of both sets of walls to find the total square footage Martha needs to paint: 240 sq ft+ 320 sq ft = <<240+320=560>>560 sq ft\nNow multiply that amount by 3 because Martha needs to add 3 coats: 560 sq ft/coat * 3 coats = <<560*3=1680>>1680 sq ft\nFinally, divide the total square footage by Martha's painting rate to find how many hours she needs to finish: 1680 sq ft / 40 sq ft/hour = <<1680/40=24>>24 hours\n#### 24",
