  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine how many feet Ian runs in a week. We begin this by multiplying the number of laps by the number of feet per lap, performing 5*100= <<5*100=5000>>5000 feet per day.\nSince there are 5 days in the period being measured, this means Ian runs 5000*5= <<25000=25000>>25000 feet jogged.\nSince it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie, this means Ian burns 25000/25=<<25000/25=1000>>1000 calories burned jogging throughout the week.\n#### 1000",
