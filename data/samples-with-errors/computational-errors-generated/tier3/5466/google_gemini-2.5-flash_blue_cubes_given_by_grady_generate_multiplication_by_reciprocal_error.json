  "flawed_nl_solution": "Grady gave 2/5 * 20 cubes = <<2/5*20=8>>8 of his red numbered cubes to Gage.\nIf Gage initially had 10 red numbered cubes, his total number of red numbered cubes became 10 cubes + 8 cubes = <<10+8=18>>18 cubes after Grady gave him 8 more.\nGrady also gave 1/3 * 15 cubes = <<1/3*15=45/1>>45/1 blue numbered cubes to Gage.\nThis increased Gage's total number of blue numbered cubes to 12 cubes + 45/1 cubes = <<12+45/1=57>>57 cubes\nThe total number of cubes Gage has is now 57 cubes + 18 cubes = <<57+18=75>>75 cubes\n#### 75",
