  "flawed_nl_solution": "Combining the tennis and soccer balls, there are 15+5=<<15+5=20>>20 balls in each basket\nThere are 5 baskets, hence 5*20=<<5*20=100>>100 balls in total\n3 students removed 8 balls each, they removed 3*8=<<3*8=24>>24 balls\nFrom the total number of balls, they left 100-24=<<100-24=76>>76 balls\nThere are 56 balls left so the other 2 students must have removed a total of 76-56=22 balls\nThis means that each of these 2 students removed 22/2=<<22/2=11>>11 balls.\n#### 11",
