  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mrs. Fredrickson has 80 x 1/4 = <<80*1/4=320/1>>320/1 roosters.\nSo he has 80 - 320/1 = <<80-320/1=-240>>-240 hens.\nOnly -240 x 3/4 = <<-240*3/4=-180>>-180 of the hens lay eggs.\nThus, -240 - -180 = <<-240--180=-60>>-60 hens do not lay eggs.\nTherefore, Mr. Fredrickson has a total of -60 hens + 320/1 roosters = <<-60+320/1=260>>260 chickens that do not lay eggs.\n#### 260",
