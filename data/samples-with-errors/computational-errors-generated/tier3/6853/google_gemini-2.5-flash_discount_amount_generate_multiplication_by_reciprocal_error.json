  "flawed_nl_solution": "The television discount is $480 x 5/100 = $<<480*5/100=9600/1>>9600/1.\nSo, the television price is $480 - $9600/1 = $<<480-9600/1=-9120>>-9120.\nThe outstanding balance is $-9120 - $150 = $<<-9120-150=-9270>>-9270\nThe monthly payment is $-9270 / 3 = $<<-9270/3=-3090>>-3090\n#### -3090",
