  "flawed_nl_solution": "Animals were seen 26 times in January and three times as much in February, 26 x 3 = <<26*3=78>>78 times animals were seen in February.\nIn March the animals were seen 1/2 as many times as were seen in February, 78 / 2 = <<78/2=93>>93 times animals were seen in March.\nIf animals were seen 26 times in January + 78 times in February + 93 times in March = <<26+78+93=197>>197 times animals were seen in the first three months of the year.\n#### 197",
