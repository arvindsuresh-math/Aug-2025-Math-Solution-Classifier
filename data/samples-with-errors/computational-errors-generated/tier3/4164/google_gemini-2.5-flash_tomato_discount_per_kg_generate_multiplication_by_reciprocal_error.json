  "flawed_nl_solution": "One kilogram of tomatoes is 20/100 * 5 = $<<20/100*5=25/1>>25/1 cheaper than one kilogram of cucumbers.\nThis means that one kilogram of tomatoes costs 5 - 25/1 = $<<5-25/1=-20>>-20.\nSo two kilograms of tomatoes is a cost of 2 * -20 = $<<2*-20=-40>>-40.\nAnd three kilograms of cucumbers is a cost of 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nSo the price for both products would be -40 + 15 = $<<-40+15=-25>>-25.\n#### -25",
