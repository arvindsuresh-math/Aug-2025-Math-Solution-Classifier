  "flawed_nl_solution": "Milly and Floretta have a total of 3 packs of their own water balloons + 2 packs of the neighbor's water balloons = <<3+2=10>>10 packs of water balloons.\nSo there is a total of 10 packs of water balloons * 6 balloons per pack of water balloons = <<10*6=60>>60 water balloons available.\nAs they split them evenly, they each have 60 water balloons / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 water balloons.\nAfter Milly steals some balloons, Floretta is left with 30 - 7 = <<30-7=23>>23 water balloons.\n#### 23",
