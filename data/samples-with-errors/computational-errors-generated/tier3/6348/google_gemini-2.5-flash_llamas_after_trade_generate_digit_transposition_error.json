  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of calves that will be born as twins is 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 calves.\nThe total number of adults and calves before the trade is 9 + 5 + 9 + 10 = <<9+5+9+10=33>>33.\nJill had 33 - 8 = <<33-8=25>>25 left for trading 8 of the claves.\nBut, she got 2 adult llamas in return, so she now has a total of 25 + 2 = <<25+2=72>>72 llamas.\nShe then sold 72 / 3 = <<72/3=24>>24 llamas in the market.\nSo, Jill has 72 - 24 = <<72-24=48>>48 llamas now.\n#### 48",
