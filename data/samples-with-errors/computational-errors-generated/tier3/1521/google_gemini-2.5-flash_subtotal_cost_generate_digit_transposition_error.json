  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=220>>220.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=360>>360.\nThus, the total amount is $220 + $360 = $<<220+360=850>>850.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 5/100 x 850 = $<<5/100*850=85/2>>85/2.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $850 - $85/2 = $<<850-85/2=1615/2>>1615/2.\n#### 1615/2",
