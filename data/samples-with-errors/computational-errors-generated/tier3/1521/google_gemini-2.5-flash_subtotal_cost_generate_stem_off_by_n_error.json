  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=220>>220.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=360>>360.\nThus, the total amount is $220 + $360 = $<<220+360=570>>570.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 5/100 x 570 = $<<5/100*570=57/2>>57/2.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $570 - $57/2 = $<<570-57/2=1083/2>>1083/2.\n#### 1083/2",
