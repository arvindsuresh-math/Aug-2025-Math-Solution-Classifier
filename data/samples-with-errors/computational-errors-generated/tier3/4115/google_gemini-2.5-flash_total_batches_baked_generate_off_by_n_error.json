  "flawed_nl_solution": "She has 24 classmates and wants to give each 10 cookies, so she needs to bake 24*10=<<24*10=240>>240 cookies\nEach batch makes 4 dozen cookies so that means each batch has 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 cookies\nShe baked 2 batches of chocolate chip and one batch of oatmeal raisin so 2+1 = <<2+1=4>>4 batches\nWe know that each batch has 48 cookies so 4*48 = <<4*48=192>>192 cookies have been baked\nShe needs to have 240 cookies and has baked 192 so 240-192 = <<240-192=48>>48 cookies are needed\nAgain, each batch makes 48 cookies and we need 48 more cookies so 48/48 = <<48/48=1>>1 more batches are needed\n#### 1",
