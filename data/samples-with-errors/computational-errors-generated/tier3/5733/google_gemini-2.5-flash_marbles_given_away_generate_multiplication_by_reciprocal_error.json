  "flawed_nl_solution": "A century has 100 years, and if Gideon has as many marbles as the number of years in a century, he has 100 marbles.\nIf he gives 3/4 of the marbles to his sister, he gives out 3/4*100 = <<3/4*100=400/3>>400/3 marbles.\nGideon's total number of marbles remaining after giving 3/4 of the marbles to his sister is 100-400/3=<<100-400/3=-100/3>>-100/3.\nWhen he multiplies the number of remaining marbles by 2, he gets his age five years from now, meaning he will be -100/3*2=<<-100/3*2=-200/3>>-200/3 years old five years from now.\nCurrently, Gideon is -200/3-5 = <<-200/3-5=-215/3>>-215/3 years old.\n#### -215/3",
