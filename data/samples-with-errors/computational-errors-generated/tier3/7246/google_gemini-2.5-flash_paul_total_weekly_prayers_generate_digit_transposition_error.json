  "flawed_nl_solution": "Pastor Paul prays 20*6=<<20*6=120>>120 days per week, except Sunday.\nOn Sunday, Pastor Paul prays 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 times.\nPer week, Pastor Paul prays 120+40=<<120+40=610>>610 times.\nPastor Bruce prays half as much as Pastor Paul does on all days except Sunday, for a total of 120/2=<<120/2=60>>60 times.\nPastor Bruce prays twice as much on Sundays as does Pastor Paul, or 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 times.\nIn total, Pastor Bruce prays 60+80=<<60+80=140>>140 times per week.\nThus, per week, Pastor Paul prays 610-140=<<610-140=470>>470 more times per week than Pastor Bruce.\n#### 470",
