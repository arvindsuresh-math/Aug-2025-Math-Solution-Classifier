  "flawed_nl_solution": "If he gathers for 2 hours, the number of minutes gathering is 2 * 60 minutes per hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes of gathering flowers\nGathering for 120 minutes / 10 minutes per flower = <<120/10=12>>12 flowers gathered\nIf he gathers 12 flowers initially but lost 3, he has 12-3 = <<12-3=10>>10 flowers gathered and kept\nSince he has 30 classmates total and has 10 flowers, he needs to gather 30-10=<<30-10=20>>20 more flowers\nAssuming it takes 10 minutes per flower, it will take him 10 * 20 = <<10*20=200>>200 minutes to gather the remaining 20 flowers needed\n#### 200",
