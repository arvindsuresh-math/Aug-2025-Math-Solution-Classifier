  "flawed_nl_solution": "The sales tax is worth $100 x 4/100 = $<<100*4/100=4>>4.\nGreg left $100 x 6/100 = $<<100*6/100=5000/3>>5000/3 tip.\nSo, the total cost for the tax and the tip is $4 + $5000/3 = $<<4+5000/3=5012/3>>5012/3\nTherefore, Greg paid $100 + $5012/3 = $<<100+5012/3=5312/3>>5312/3 in all.\n#### 5312/3",
