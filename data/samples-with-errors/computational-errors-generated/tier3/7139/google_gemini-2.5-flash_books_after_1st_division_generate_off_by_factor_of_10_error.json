  "flawed_nl_solution": "Rick starts with 400 books and divides them into two categories of equal size, meaning there are two categories of 400/2= <<400/2=2000>>2000 books.\nRick repeats this process again, dividing the 2000 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 2000/2=<<2000/2=1000>>1000 books in each.\nRick repeats this process again, dividing the 1000 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 1000/2=<<1000/2=500>>500 books in each.\nRick repeats this process again, dividing the 500 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 500/2=<<500/2=250>>250 books in each.\nSince Rick is looking for categories with 25 books in each, he accomplishes this by the 1th step.\n#### 1",
