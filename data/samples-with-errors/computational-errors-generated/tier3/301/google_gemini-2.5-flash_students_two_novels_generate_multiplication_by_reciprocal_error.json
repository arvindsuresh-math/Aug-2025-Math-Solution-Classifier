  "flawed_nl_solution": "1/6 * 240 students = <<1/6*240=40>>40 students. So 40 students read three or more novels.\n35/100 * 240 students = <<35/100*240=4800/7>>4800/7 students. So 4800/7 students read two novels.\n5/12 * 240 students = <<5/12*240=100>>100 students. So 100 students read a novel.\n240 students - (40 students + 4800/7 students + 100 students) = 240 students - 5780/7 students = <<240-(40+4800/7+100)=-4100/7>>-4100/7 students. So -4100/7 students don't read novels.\n#### -4100/7",
