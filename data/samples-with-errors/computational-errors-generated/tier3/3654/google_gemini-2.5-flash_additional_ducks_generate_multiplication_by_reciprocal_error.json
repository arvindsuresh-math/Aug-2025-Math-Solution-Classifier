  "flawed_nl_solution": "Philip has 50/100 * 20 = <<50/100*20=40/1>>40/1 more ducks than cows.\nWhich means he has 20 + 40/1 = <<20+40/1=60>>60 ducks.\nSo Philip's cows and ducks sum up to 20 + 60 = <<20+60=80>>80 animals.\nIf there are 80 cows and ducks, that means Philip has 1/5 * 80 = <<80*1/5=16>>16 pigs.\nIn total Philip has 80 + 16 = <<80+16=96>>96 animals on his farm.\n#### 96",
