  "flawed_nl_solution": "First you must recognize that the problem involves finding the rate of how fast Ms. Alice can grade papers. To find how many papers she can grade in 11 hours, it would be useful to first find out how many papers she can grade in one hour. To do so, divide 296 papers by 8 hours, 296/8, to get 37. Therefore, Ms. Alice can grade 37 papers in one hour.\nTo find out how many papers she can grade in 11 hours, multiply the number of papers she can grade in one hour by 11. 37 * 11 gives you <<37*11=470>>470. Ms. Alice can grade 470 papers in 11 hours.\n#### 470",
