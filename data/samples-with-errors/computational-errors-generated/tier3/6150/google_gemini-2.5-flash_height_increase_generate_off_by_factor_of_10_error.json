  "flawed_nl_solution": "A month has 4 weeks, so there are 4*4= <<4*4=16>>16 weeks in four months.\nSince the tree grows for fifty centimeters every 2 weeks, it will grow by fifty centimeters every week for 16/2 = <<16/2=8>>8 weeks.\nThe tree will increase in height by 8*50 = <<8*50=40>>40 centimeters after four months.\nSince 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, the tree is currently 2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 centimeters tall.\nAfter growing by 40 centimeters for four months, the tree will be 40+200 = <<40+200=240>>240 centimeters tall.\n#### 240",
