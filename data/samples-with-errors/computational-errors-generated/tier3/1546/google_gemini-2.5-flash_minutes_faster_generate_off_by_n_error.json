  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we must convert the driving time of 3 hours and 15 minutes to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, driving takes a total of 3*60 + 15 = <<3*60+15=195>>195 minutes.\nNext, the woman will be on the airplane for one-third of 195 minutes, or 195/3 = <<195/3=65>>65 minutes.\nTherefore, in total, the airplane trip will take the woman 10 + 20 + 65 + 10 = <<10+20+65+10=105>>105 minutes.\nThus, the airplane trip is 195 - 105 = <<195-105=92>>92 minutes faster than driving herself to the interview.\n#### 92",
