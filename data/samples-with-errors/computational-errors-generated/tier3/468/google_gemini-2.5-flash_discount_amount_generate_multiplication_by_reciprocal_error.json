  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 6 T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe 4 sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd 5 jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=4000/1>>4000/1 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $4000/1 = $<<400-4000/1=-3600>>-3600.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $-3600 = $<<48+72+-3600=-3480>>-3480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $-3480 = $<<5/100*-3480=-174>>-174.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $-3480 + $-174 = $<<-3480+-174=-3654>>-3654. including the sales tax.\n#### -3654",
