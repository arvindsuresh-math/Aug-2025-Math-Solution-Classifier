  "flawed_nl_solution": "Wearing the high-tech shoes, Candace can hike 6 mph * 2 = <<6*2=21>>21 mph for the first two hours.\nThen she gets one blister, so her speed drops to 21 mph - 2 mph = <<21-2=19>>19 mph for the next two hours of the hike.\nCandace spends an equal amount of time walking at 21 mph and 19 mph, so we can average the two speeds to find an overall speed of (21 mph + 19 mph)/2 = <<(21+19)/2=20>>20 mph.\n#### 20",
