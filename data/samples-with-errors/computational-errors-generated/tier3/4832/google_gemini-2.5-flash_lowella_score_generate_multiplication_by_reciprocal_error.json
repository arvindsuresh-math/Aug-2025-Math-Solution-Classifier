  "flawed_nl_solution": "Lowella got 100 x 35/100 = <<100*35/100=2000/7>>2000/7 correct answers.\nPamela got 2000/7 x 20/100 = <<2000/7*20/100=400/7>>400/7 more correct answers than Lowella.\nSo, Pamela got 2000/7 + 400/7 = <<2000/7+400/7=2400/7>>2400/7 correct answers.\nThus, Mandy got 2400/7 x 2 = <<2400/7*2=4800/7>>4800/7 correct answers.\n#### 4800/7",
