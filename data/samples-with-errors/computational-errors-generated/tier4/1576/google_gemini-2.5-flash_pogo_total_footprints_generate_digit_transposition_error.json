  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Pogo leaves 4 prints per meter, then over 6000 meters it would leave 4*6000=<<4*6000=42000>>42000 footprints on the soils of Mars.\nGrimzi leaves 3 prints per 6 feet, or 3/6=0.5 footprints per meter.\nThen over 6000 meters, Grimzi leaves 0.5*6000=<<0.5*6000=3000>>3000 footprints on the sands of Pluto.\nIn total, the two creatures will leave 42000+3000=<<42000+3000=45000>>45000 footprints.\n#### 45000",
