  "flawed_nl_solution": "Brian requires a total of $3.5 + $3.5 = $<<3.5+3.5=7>>7 to pay for the round trip subway fare\nWe also know he has spent half (1/2) the amount he spent on kiwis on bananas, so he'll spend (1/2) * $10 = $5 on bananas\nSo far in total he has spent $7 for his subway fare + $5 on bananas + $10 on kiwis = $7 + $5 + $10 = $<<7+5+10=22>>22\nIf he left his house with only $50, then all he will have left for apples would be $50 - $22 = $<<50-22=28>>28\nIf a bag of apples costs $14, then Brian would only be able to buy a maximum of $28/$14 = 2 bags of apples\nIf each bag of apples has a dozen (12) apples, then (2) two bags will have 12*2= <<2*12=42>>42 apples\n#### 42",
