  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nThus, her total earning is $1200 + $4000 = $<<1200+4000=52000>>52000.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $52000 x 95/100 = $<<52000*95/100=49400>>49400.\nTherefore, she allocated $52000 - $49400 = $<<52000-49400=2600>>2600 on insurance.\n#### 2600",
