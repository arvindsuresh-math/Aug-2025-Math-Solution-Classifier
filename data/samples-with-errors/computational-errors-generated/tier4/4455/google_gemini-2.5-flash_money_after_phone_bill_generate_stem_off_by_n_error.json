  "flawed_nl_solution": "Abigail had $20 + $40 = $<<20+40=30>>30 left after paying her phone bill.\nThe $30 is 100% - 25% = 75% of the remainder of her money after spending for food.\nSince 75% is $30, then 1% is $30/75 = $<<30/75=0.4>>0.4.\nThus, Abigail had $0.4 x 100 = $<<0.4*100=40>>40 left after she spent money on food.\nThe $40 is 100% - 60% = 40% of her original money.\nSo 1% is $40/40 = $<<40/40=1>>1.\nTherefore, Abigail initially had $1 x 100 = $<<1*100=100>>100.\n#### 100",
