  "flawed_nl_solution": "Abigail had $20 + $40 = $<<20+40=60>>60 left after paying her phone bill.\nThe $60 is 100% - 25% = 75% of the remainder of her money after spending for food.\nSince 75% is $60, then 1% is $60/75 = $<<60/75=8>>8.\nThus, Abigail had $8 x 100 = $<<8*100=800>>800 left after she spent money on food.\nThe $800 is 100% - 60% = 40% of her original money.\nSo 1% is $800/40 = $<<800/40=20>>20.\nTherefore, Abigail initially had $20 x 100 = $<<20*100=2000>>2000.\n#### 2000",
