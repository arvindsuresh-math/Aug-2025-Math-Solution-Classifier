  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total earnings for the paper cover version were $0.2 x 32000 = $<<0.2*32000=6400>>6400.\nSo, the author earned $6400 x 6/100 = $384 from the paper cover version.\nThe total earnings for the hardcover version were $0.4 x 15000 = $<<0.4*15000=6000>>6000.\nSo, the author earned $6000 x 12/100 = $<<6000*12/100=270>>270 from the hardcover version.\nTherefore, the author earned a total of $384 + $270 = $<<384+270=654>>654.\n#### 654",
