  "flawed_nl_solution": "Laura bought 2 salads, for 2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\nOne kilogram of beef is 2 times more expensive than one salad, which means it cost 2 * 3 = $6.\nSo Laura spend 2 * 6 = $<<2*6=21>>21 on beef.\nOne kilogram of potatoes costs only 3 * 1/3 = $<<3*1/3=1>>1, and that's how much Laura paid for potatoes.\nLaura bought 2 liters of juice, so she did spend on them 2 * 1.5 = $<<2*1.5=3>>3.\nSo in total Laura paid 6 + 21 + 1 + 3 = $<<6+21+1+3=31>>31.\n#### 31",
