  "flawed_nl_solution": "The pants are $30 and are buy one get one 1/2 off so the second pair will be 30*0.5 = $<<30*0.5=15>>15\nThe first pair of pants is $30 and the second pair is $15 so the pants cost 30+15 = $<<30+15=49>>49\nThe skirts are $20 each and she's buying 3 so that's 20*3 = $<<20*3=60>>60\nThe blouses are $15 each and she's buying 5 so that's 15*5 = $<<15*5=75>>75\nAll total, her wardrobe will cost $49 for the pants, $60 for the skirts and $75 for the blouses so 49+60+75 = $<<49+60+75=184>>184\n#### 184",
