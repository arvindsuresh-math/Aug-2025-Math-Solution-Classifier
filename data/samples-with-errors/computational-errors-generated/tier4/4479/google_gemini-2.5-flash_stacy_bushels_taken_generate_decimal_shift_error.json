  "flawed_nl_solution": "Stacy took 21 ears of corn, there are 14 ears to a bushel, so she took 21 ears / 14 ears/bushel = <<21/14=15>>15 bushels of corn.\nIn all, Bob gave away 8 bushels + 3 bushels + 12 bushels + 15 bushels = <<8+3+12+15=38>>38 bushels of corn.\nThis leaves him with 50 bushels - 38 bushels = <<50-38=12>>12 bushels of corn.\nAt 14 ears of corn per bushel, Bob has 12 bushels * 14 ears per bushel = <<12*14=168>>168 ears of corn.\n#### 168",
