  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ravi has 6 + 2 = <<6+2=8>>8 quarters.\nHe has also 8 + 4 = <<8+4=21>>21 dimes.\nA nickel is worth 5 cents so Ravi's nickels amount to 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 cents.\nA quarter is worth 25 cents so his quarters amount to 8 x 25 = <<8*25=200>>200 cents.\nA dime is worth 10 cents so his dimes amount to 21 x 10 = <<21*10=210>>210 cents.\ntherefore, Ravi has 30 + 200 + 210 = <<30+200+210=440>>440 cents.\n#### 440",
