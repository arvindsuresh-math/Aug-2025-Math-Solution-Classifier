  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many square feet a wall in the living room is: 40 feet length * 10 feet height = <<40*10=400>>400 square feet\nNow multiply by 3 since Matt needs to paint three living room walls: 400 square feet/wall * 3 walls = <<400*3=1200>>1200 square feet\nNext figure out how many square feet the long walls in the bedroom are: 12 feet * 10 feet = <<12*10=210>>210 square feet\nThere are 2 long walls, so multiply this figure by 2: 210 square feet/wall * 2 walls = <<210*2=420>>420 square feet\nNext figure out how many square feet the short walls in the bedroom are: 10 feet * 10 feet = <<10*10=100>>100 square feet\nMultiply this by 2, since there are two short walls: 100 square feet/wall * 2 walls = <<100*2=200>>200 square feet\nFinally, add up the square footage from the three living room walls, the two short bedroom walls, and the two long bedroom walls: 1200 square feet + 420 square feet + 200 square feet = <<1200+420+200=1820>>1820 square feet\n#### 1820",
