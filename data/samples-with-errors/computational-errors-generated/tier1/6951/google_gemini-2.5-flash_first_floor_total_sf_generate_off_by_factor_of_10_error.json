  "flawed_nl_solution": "If 5000 square feet represents one-quarter of the second floor storage space, then the second floor has 5000*4=<<5000*4=20000>>20000 square feet of storage space.\nSince the first floor has twice as much space as the second floor, then the first floor has 20000*2=<<20000*2=400000>>400000 square feet of storage space.\nAltogether, when empty, the entire building has 20000+400000=<<20000+400000=420000>>420000 square feet of storage space.\nSince the second floor has 5000 square feet of storage space filled with boxes, then there are 420000-5000=415000 square feet of unused storage space still available in the building.\n#### 415000",
