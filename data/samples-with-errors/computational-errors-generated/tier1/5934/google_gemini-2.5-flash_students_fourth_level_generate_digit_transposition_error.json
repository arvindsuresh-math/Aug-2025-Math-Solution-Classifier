  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ms. Cole's sixth-level math class has 40 students and four times as many students in her fourth-level class, there are 4*40 = <<4*40=610>>610 in her fourth-level math class.\nFor the two levels, Ms. Cole teaches math to 610+40 = <<610+40=650>>650 students.\nIf the number of students in her seventh-level math class is twice that in the fourth-level math class, then she teaches 2*610 = <<2*610=1220>>1220 students in the seventh-level math class.\nMs. Cole teaches 1220+650 = <<1220+650=1870>>1870 math students in the school.\n#### 1870",
