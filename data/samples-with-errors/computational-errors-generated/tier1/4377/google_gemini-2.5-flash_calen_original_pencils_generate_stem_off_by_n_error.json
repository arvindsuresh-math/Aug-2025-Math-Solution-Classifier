  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then Calen originally had 10+10=<<10+10=40>>40 pencils.\nCalen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and thus Caleb has 40-5=<<40-5=35>>35 pencils.\nThis simplifies to 2*x=38.\nThus, the number of pencils owned by Candy is x=<<19=19>>19 pencils.\n#### 19",
