  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, figure out how many gallons of gas Marcus bought by multiply the gas tank's volume by the number of fill-ups: 20 gallons * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 gallons\nThen multiply that number by Marcus's fuel mileage to find how many miles he drove: 40 gallons * 30 miles/gallon = <<40*30=120>>120 miles\nThen add that amount to the initial number of miles on Marcus' car to find the final number of miles: 1728 miles + 120 miles = <<1728+120=1848>>1848 miles\n#### 1848",
