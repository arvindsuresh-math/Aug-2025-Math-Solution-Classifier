  "flawed_nl_solution": "If on the return journey to its home, the alligator took 2 more hours than it took to travel to the Nile Delta, Paul took 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 hours to travel back to its home.\nThe total time Paul took to travel from its home to the Nile Delta and back is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10\nOn his return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and since each alligator traveled for 6 hours up the Nile to their home, they took a total of 6*6=<<6*6=63>>63 hours to do so.\nTogether with Paul, all the alligators took 10+63=<<10+63=73>>73 hours traveling between Nile Delta and up the Nile.\n#### 73",
