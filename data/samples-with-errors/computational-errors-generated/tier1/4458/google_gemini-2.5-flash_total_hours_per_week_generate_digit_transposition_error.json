  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we find the number of hours per weekday by subtracting the smaller number time from the larger one, finding 10-4= <<10-4=6>>6 hours per weekday.\nAs there are 5 weekdays, this means the business is open 6*5=30 hours a week on the weekdays.\nThen we find out the amount of time the business is open on a weekend day, using the same process as we did with the weekdays, finding Jean's business is open 10-6= <<10-6=4>>4 hours each weekend day.\nSince there are 2 weekend days, this means they are open 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours on the weekends.\nWe add these two totals together to find that 30+8= <<30+8=83>>83 hours per week.\n#### 83",
