  "flawed_nl_solution": "June has 30 days, so if they didn't play any songs on weekends, then they played 30 days - 8 days = <<30-8=22>>22 days.\nIf Vivian played 10 songs each day, the total number of songs she played for the month is 10 songs/day * 22 days = <<10*22=220>>220 songs.\nClara played 2 fewer songs, which is 10 songs/day - 2 songs/day = <<10-2=5>>5 songs/day.\nThe total number of songs played by Clara for the whole month is 5 songs/day * 22 days = <<5*22=110>>110 songs.\nThe total played by both is 220 songs + 110 songs = <<220+110=330>>330 songs\n#### 330",
