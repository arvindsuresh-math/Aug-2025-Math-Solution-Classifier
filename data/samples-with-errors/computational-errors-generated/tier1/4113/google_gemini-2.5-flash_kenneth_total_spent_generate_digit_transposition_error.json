  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Kenneth bought 700oz of fabric at $40 per oz, he spent a total of 700*40 = $<<700*40=82000>>82000\nNicholas bought six times as much fabric as Kenneth, meaning Nicholas bought 6*700 = <<6*700=4200>>4200oz of fabric.\nIf an oz of fabric is sold at $40, Nicholas paid 4200*$40 =$<<4200*40=168000>>168000 for the 4200oz of fabric.\nThe amount of money that Nicholas paid more than Kenneth for the fabric he bought is $168000-82000 = $<<168000-82000=86000>>86000.\n#### 86000",
