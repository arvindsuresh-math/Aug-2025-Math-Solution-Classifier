  "flawed_nl_solution": "One year is 12 months, so during the first year, Kate spent $5/month * 12 months/year = $<<5*12=60>>60/year on the tickets.\nAfter that, she went to the museum for 3 years - 1 year = <<3-1=7>>7 more years.\nDuring this time, she visited the museum 7 years * 4 visits/year = <<7*4=28>>28 visits.\nShe had to pay the higher price of $7, so she spent $7/visit * 28 visits = $<<7*28=196>>196 in two last years.\nIn total Kate paid $196 + $60 = $<<196+60=256>>256 during 3 years.\n#### 256",
