  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of the two laptops is 2 x $600 = $<<2*600=1020>>1020.\nThe cost of the four smartphones is 4 x $400 = $<<4*400=1600>>1600.\nThus, the total cost of all the items is $1020 + $1600 = $<<1020+1600=2620>>2620.\nTherefore, Celine gets a change of $3000 - $2620 = $<<3000-2620=380>>380.\n#### 380",
