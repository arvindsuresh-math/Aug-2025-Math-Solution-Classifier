  "flawed_nl_solution": "Sansa earns $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 every day by selling three 8-inch portraits.\nThe price of the 16-inch portrait is $5 x 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 each.\nSo, she earns $10 x 5 = $<<10*5=50>>50 every day by selling five 16-inch portraits.\nHer total earnings is $50 + $15 = $<<50+15=65>>65 every day.\nTherefore, the total amount she earns after 3 days is $65 x 3 = $<<65*3=159>>159.\n#### 159",
