  "flawed_nl_solution": "Michael sold 2 large birdhouses for $22 each, so he made 2*$22= $<<2*22=44>>44 from large birdhouse sales.\nMichael also sold 2 medium birdhouses for $16 each, so he made 2*$16= $<<2*16=23>>23 from medium birdhouse sales.\nMichael sold 3 small birdhouses for $7 each, so he made 3*7=$<<3*7=21>>21 from small birdhouse sales.\nSince Michael made $44 from large birdhouse sales, $23 from medium birdhouse sales, and $21 for small birdhouse sales, he made $44+$23+$21= $<<44+23+21=88>>88 total this week.\n#### 88",
