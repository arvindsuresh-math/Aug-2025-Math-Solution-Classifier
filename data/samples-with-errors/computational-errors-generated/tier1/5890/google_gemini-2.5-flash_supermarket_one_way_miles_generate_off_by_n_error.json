  "flawed_nl_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 miles to school in one week.\nThe supermarket is 10 miles farther away than the school. Therefore the supermarket is 10 + 10 = <<10+10=21>>21 miles away from Laura's house\nLaura drives 21 miles each way to and from the supermarket. Each trip is 21 x 2 = <<21*2=42>>42 miles.\nLaura drives 42 miles twice a week to visit the supermarket. Therefore she drives 42 x 2 =<<42*2=84>>84 miles in total a week to and from the supermarket.\nIn total Laura drives 140 + 84 = <<140+84=224>>224 miles each week.\n#### 224",
