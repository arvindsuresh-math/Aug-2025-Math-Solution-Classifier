  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total runtime for the first three machines is 3 machines * 23 hours/day/machine = <<3*23=96>>96 hours/day.\nSo these machines could produce 96 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = <<96*2=192>>192 kg/day.\nThe fourth machine could produce 12 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = <<12*2=24>>24 kg/day of material.\nIn total all the machines would produce 192 kg/day + 24 kg/day = <<192+24=216>>216 kg/day of material.\nThe factory would therefore earn 216 kg/day * $50/kg = $<<216*50=10800>>10800/day.\n#### 10800",
