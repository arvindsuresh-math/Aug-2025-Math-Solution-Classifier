  "flawed_nl_solution": "First let's find the number for each animal separately, 42 teeth per dog * 5 dogs = <<42*5=120>>120 teeth for dogs.\nThen cats total will be 30 teeth per cat * 10 cats = <<30*10=300>>300 teeth in total for cats.\nFinally, the number for pigs is 28 teeth per pig * 7 pigs = <<28*7=196>>196 teeth in total for pigs.\nSo the total in all is 120 teeth + 300 teeth + 196 teeth = <<120+300+196=616>>616 teeth in total.\n#### 616",
