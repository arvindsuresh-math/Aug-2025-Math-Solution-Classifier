  "flawed_nl_solution": "The corner light cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nEach brake disk costs $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.\nSo, the total price of the brake disks is $60x 2 = $<<60*2=102>>102.\nHe spent $10 + $20 + $102 = $<<10+20+102=132>>132 for the repair.\nTherefore, Robe has saved $480 + 132 = $<<480+132=612>>612 before his car broke.\n#### 612",
