  "flawed_nl_solution": "William spends 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = <<4+7+4+9=26>>26 minutes washing a normal car.\nHe washed 2 normal cars, so he spent 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 minutes on the normal cars.\nHe took twice as long as one car for the SUV, so he took 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 minutes on the SUV.\nThus, William spent 52 + 52 = <<52+52=104>>104 minutes washing all the vehicles.\n#### 104",
