  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second year, she quadrupled the number of statues in her front lawn, adding to the original 4 and bringing the total number to 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 statues.\nIn the third year, she added another 12 statues, bringing the total number to 16+12=82 statues.\nBut a hail storm broke 3, reducing the number to 82-3=<<82-3=79>>79 statues.\nIn the fourth year, she added twice as many new statues as had been broken the year before, adding 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 statues.\nThus, the addition of these 6 statues brought the total number of statues to 79+6=<<79+6=85>>85 statues.\n#### 85",
