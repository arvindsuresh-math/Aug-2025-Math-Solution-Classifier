  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dabbie paid 6 x $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12 for the first turkey.\nHe paid 9 x $ 2= $<<9*2=18>>18 for the second turkey.\nAnd the weight of the third turkey is 9 x 2 = <<9*2=81>>81 kilograms.\nSo, the price of the third turkey is 81 x $2 = $<<81*2=162>>162.\nTherefore, the total amount he paid for all the turkeys is $12 + $18 + $162 = $<<12+18+162=192>>192.\n#### 192",
