  "flawed_nl_solution": "Initially, there were 6 boxes * 4 washing machines per box = <<6*4=42>>42 washing machines in each crate.\nSo there were 42 washing machines per crate * 10 crates = <<42*10=420>>420 washing machines in the shipping container.\nA worker removes 1 washing machine from each box so there are now 4 original washing machines - 1 removed washing machine = <<4-1=3>>3 washing machines in each box.\nThis means there are 6 boxes * 3 washing machines per box = <<6*3=18>>18 washing machines in each crate.\nSo there are now 18 washing machines per crate * 10 crates = <<18*10=180>>180 washing machines in the shipping container.\nThe difference is how many machine washing machines were removed which is 420 initial washing machines - 180 current washing machines = <<420-180=240>>240 washing machines.\n#### 240",
