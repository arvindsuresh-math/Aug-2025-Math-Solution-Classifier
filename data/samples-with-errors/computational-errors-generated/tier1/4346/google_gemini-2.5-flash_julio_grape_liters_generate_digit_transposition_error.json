  "flawed_nl_solution": "Julio has 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters of orange soda\nJulio also has 7 * 2 = <<7*2=41>>41 liters of grape soda.\nJulio therefore has a total of 8 + 41 = <<8+41=49>>49 liters of soda\nThe amount of orange soda that Mateo has is 1 * 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 liters of orange soda\nIn addition, Mateo has 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 liters of grape soda.\nIn total, Mateo has 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 liters of soda.\nThis means that Julio has 49 - 8 = <<49-8=41>>41 liters more of soda\n#### 41",
