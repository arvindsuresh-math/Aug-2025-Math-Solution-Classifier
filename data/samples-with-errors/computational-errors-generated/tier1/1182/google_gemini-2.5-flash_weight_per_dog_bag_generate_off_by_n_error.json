  "flawed_nl_solution": "The two bags of cat food weigh 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 pounds.\nEach bag of dog food weighs 3 + 2 = <<3+2=9>>9 pounds.\nSo two bags of dog food weigh 2 x 9 = <<2*9=18>>18 pounds.\nThus, Mrs. Anderson bought 6 + 18 = <<6+18=24>>24 pounds of pet food.\nAnd 24 pounds is equal to 24 x 16 = <<24*16=384>>384 ounces.\n#### 384",
