  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of people by adding the number of passengers and flight crew: 30 people + 5 people = <<30+5=39>>39 people\nThen find the total number of bags by doubling the total number of people: 39 people * 2 bags/person = <<39*2=78>>78 bags\nThen find the fuel increase caused by the people by multiplying their number by the fuel increase per person: 39 people * 3 gallons/mile/person = <<39*3=117>>117 gallons/mile\nThen multiply the number of bags by the fuel increase per bag to find the total fuel increase they cause: 78 bags * 2 gallons/mile/bag = <<78*2=156>>156 gallons/mile\nNow add the fuel increases to the base fuel consumption to find the total fuel needed per mile: 156 gallons/mile + 117 gallons/mile + 20 gallons/mile = <<156+117+20=293>>293 gallons/mile\nNow multiply the fuel consumption per mile by the number of miles flown to find the total amount of fuel needed: 293 gallons/mile * 400 miles = <<293*400=117200>>117200 gallons of fuel\n#### 117200",
