  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = <<4*3=21>>21 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 21 * 7 = <<21*7=147>>147 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 147 * 2 = <<147*2=294>>294 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 294 - 8 = <<294-8=286>>286 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n#### 286",
