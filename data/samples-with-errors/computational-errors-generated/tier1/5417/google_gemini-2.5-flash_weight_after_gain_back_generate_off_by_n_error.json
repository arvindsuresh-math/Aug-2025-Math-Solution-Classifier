  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Mary first weighed 99 pounds, after she dropped a dozen pounds she weighed 99-12=<<99-12=87>>87 pounds.\nTwice the weight she initially lost is 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 pounds.\nSo, when she added back twice the weight that she initially lost, her weight jumped to 87+24=<<87+24=116>>116 pounds.\nThree times more than she initially had lost is 12*3=<<12*3=36>>36 pounds.\nTherefore, when Mary lost 3 times more than she initially lost, her weight dropped to 116-36=<<116-36=80>>80 pounds.\nFinally, when Mary gained back half of a dozen pounds, her final weight was 80+6=<<80+6=86>>86 pounds.\n#### 86",
