  "flawed_nl_solution": "The booth made $50 x 3 = $<<50*3=150>>150 selling cotton candy each day.\nIn a day, the booth made a total of $150 + $50 = $<<150+50=200>>200.\nIn 5 days, they made a total of $200 x 5 = $<<200*5=1000>>1000.\nThe booth has to pay a total of $30 + $75 = $<<30+75=150>>150.\nThus, the booth earned $1000 - $150 = $<<1000-150=850>>850.\n#### 850",
