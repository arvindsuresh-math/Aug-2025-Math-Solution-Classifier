  "flawed_nl_solution": "The flower shop sold 45 + 20 = <<45+20=65>>65 daisies on the second day.\nTwice the number of flowers on the second day is 65 x 2 = <<65*2=103>>103.\nSo, the flower shop sold 103 - 10 = <<103-10=93>>93 daisies on the third day.\nThe total daisies sold for 3 days was 45 + 65 + 93 = <<45+65+93=203>>203.\nTherefore, 350 - 203 = <<350-203=147>>147 daisies were sold on the 4th day.\n#### 147",
