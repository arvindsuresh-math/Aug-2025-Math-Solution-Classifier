  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Darryl has 20 books, Lamont, who has twice the number of books Darryl has, has 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40 books.\nThe total number of books both Darryl and Lamont has is 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 books.\nTo have the same number of books as Lamont, Loris needs 3 more books, meaning she has 40-3 = <<40-3=37>>37 books.\nIn total, the three has 60+37= <<60+37=98>>98 books\n#### 98",
