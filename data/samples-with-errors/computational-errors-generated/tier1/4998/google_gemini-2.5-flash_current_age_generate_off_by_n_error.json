  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since, three years from now, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair, this year she has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 colors in her hair.\nSince she had 2 colors in her hair at the age of 15, she has added 5-2=3 colors since she was 15 years old.\nSince she ads one color per year, 3 added colors = <<3=3>>3 added years\nThus, currently, she is 15+3=<<15+3=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19",
