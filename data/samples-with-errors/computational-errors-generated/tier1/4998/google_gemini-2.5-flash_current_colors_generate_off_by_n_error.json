  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since, three years from now, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair, this year she has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=9>>9 colors in her hair.\nSince she had 2 colors in her hair at the age of 15, she has added 9-2=7 colors since she was 15 years old.\nSince she ads one color per year, 7 added colors = <<7=7>>7 added years\nThus, currently, she is 15+7=<<15+7=22>>22 years old.\n#### 22",
