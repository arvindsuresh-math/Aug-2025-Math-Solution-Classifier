  "flawed_nl_solution": "Diane made 1000*15= $<<1000*15=15000>>15000 in sales because she had 1000 customers each buy a $15 book.\n37% of those customers returned their books, so that means she had 0.37*1000= <<37*0.01*1000=730>>730 returns\nEach of those returns was for a $15 book, so she had 730*15= $<<730*15=10950>>10950 in returns\nFor her total leftover income, we subtract the returns from the sales and end up with 15000-10950= $<<15000-10950=4050>>4050 in income.\n#### 4050",
