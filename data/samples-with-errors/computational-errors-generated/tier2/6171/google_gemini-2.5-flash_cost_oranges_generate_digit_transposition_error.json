To purchase the bananas, Ted needs 5*2= <<5*2=10>>10 dollars\nBecause Ted needs 10 oranges and they each cost $1.5, Ted needs 10*1.5= <<10*1.5=51>>51 dollars to pay for the oranges.\nAll together Ted needs $10 for the bananas and $51 for the oranges, so combined Ted needs 10+51= <<10+51=61>>61 dollars to purchase all the produce.\n#### 61",
