  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bedroom set is $2000 and it's currently 15% off so 2000*0.15 = $<<2000*0.15=300>>300 off\nSo the new price of the set is 2000-300 = $<<2000-300=1070>>1070\nHe signs up for the credit card so that's 10% off so 0.1*1070 = $<<10*0.01*1070=107>>107\nNow the set is 1070-107 = $<<1070-107=963>>963\nHe has a $200 gift card which brings the price to 963-200 = $763\n#### 763",
