  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much Mary pays weekly for the trash bins: $10/trash bin * 2 trash bins = $<<10*2=20>>20\nThen add this to the cost of the recycling bin: $20 + $5 = $<<20+5=25>>25\nThen multiply the week cost by the number of weeks per month to find the monthly cost: $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<25*4=1000>>1000/month\nNow calculate Mary's senior discount: 18% * $1000 = $<<18*0.01*1000=180>>180\nNow subtract the discount and add the fine to find the total monthly cost: $1000 - $180 + $20 = $<<1000-180+20=840>>840\n#### 840",
