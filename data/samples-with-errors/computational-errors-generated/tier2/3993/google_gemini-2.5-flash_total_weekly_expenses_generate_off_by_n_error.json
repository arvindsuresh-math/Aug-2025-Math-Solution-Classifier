  "flawed_nl_solution": "He is open 16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 hours a week\nSo he pays each of his employees 12.5*80=$<<12.5*80=1000>>1000 per week\nSince there are 2 employees, he pays them in total 2 * $1000 = $<<2*1000=2000>>2000 per week.\nThe utilities cost 1200*0.2=$<<1200*0.2=240>>240\nSo his total cost per week is 1200+2000+240=$<<1200+2000+240=3435>>3435\n#### 3435",
