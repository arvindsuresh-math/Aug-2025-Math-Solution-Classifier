  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of a regularly-priced uniform is $7.5 for the shirt + $15 for pants + $4.5 for socks = $<<7.5+15+4.5=72>>72.\nThe cost of a discounted uniform is $6.75 for the shirt + $13.5 for pants + $3.75 for socks = $<<6.75+13.5+3.75=24>>24.\nBy purchasing the discounted uniform, each team member would save $72 for full price - $24 for discounted= $<<72-24=48>>48.\nSo, for the team of 12, they would save $48 * 12 = $<<48*12=576>>576\n#### 576",
