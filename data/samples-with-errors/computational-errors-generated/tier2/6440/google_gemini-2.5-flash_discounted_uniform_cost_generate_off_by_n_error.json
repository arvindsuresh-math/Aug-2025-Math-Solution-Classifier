  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of a regularly-priced uniform is $7.5 for the shirt + $15 for pants + $4.5 for socks = $<<7.5+15+4.5=27>>27.\nThe cost of a discounted uniform is $6.75 for the shirt + $13.5 for pants + $3.75 for socks = $<<6.75+13.5+3.75=23>>23.\nBy purchasing the discounted uniform, each team member would save $27 for full price - $23 for discounted= $<<27-23=4>>4.\nSo, for the team of 12, they would save $4 * 12 = $<<4*12=48>>48\n#### 48",
