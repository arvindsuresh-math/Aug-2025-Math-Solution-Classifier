  "flawed_nl_solution": "Yanni's mother gave him $0.4 in addition to $0.85 for a total of $0.4+$0.85 = $<<0.4+0.85=1.25>>1.25.\nYanni found $0.5 so he had a total of $1.25 + $0.5 = $<<1.25+0.5=1.75>>1.75\nTherefore, Yanni had $1.75 - $1.6 = $<<1.75-1.6=0.01>>0.01 left\n100 cents make $1 so $0.01 is 100*0.01 = <<100*0.01=1.5>>1.5 cents\n#### 1.5",
