  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 20 - 2 = <<20-2=81>>81 floors that are each 3 meters high.\nSo the first 81 floors is 81 x 3 = <<81*3=243>>243 meters high.\nThe last two floors are each 3 + 0.5 = <<3+0.5=3.5>>3.5 meters high.\nSo the total height of the last two floors is 3.5 x 2 = <<3.5*2=7>>7 meters.\nTherefore, the building is 243 + 7 = <<243+7=250>>250 meters high.\n#### 250",
