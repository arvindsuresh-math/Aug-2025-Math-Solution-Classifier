  "flawed_nl_solution": "Hannah's earnings from the cookies is 40 x $0.8 = $<<40*0.8=32>>32.\nHer earnings from the cupcakes is 30 x $2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.\nHer total earnings for the cupcakes and cookies is $32 + $60 = $<<32+60=92>>92.\nThe cost of 2 sets of measuring spoons is 2 x $6.5 = $<<2*6.5=13>>13.\nSo, Hannah has $92 - $13 = $<<92-13=82>>82.\n#### 82",
