  "flawed_nl_solution": "He needs 500 * 12 = <<500*12=6000>>6000 square feet\nThis means it cost $5 * 6000 = $30000\nThat means construction comes to $30000 * 2 = $<<30000*2=60000>>60000\nSo the total cost is $60000 + $30000 = $<<60000+30000=89970>>89970\nHis partner covers $89970 * 0.4 = $<<89970*0.4=35988>>35988\nSo he has to pay $89970 - $35988 = $<<89970-35988=53982>>53982\n#### 53982",
