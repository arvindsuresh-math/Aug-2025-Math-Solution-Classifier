  "flawed_nl_solution": "If a cab ride costs $2.5 per mile, and Briar has to go to an event 200 miles away, he will spend 200* $2.5 = $<<200*2.5=500>>500 one way to the trip.\nSince the round trip is also 200 miles and Briar is charged $500, the total amount he spends in a day to go to the event and back is $500+$500 = $<<500+500=1003>>1003\nThe event is one week, meaning Briar will have to spend $1003*7 = $<<1003*7=7021>>7021 on the cab rides\n#### 7021",
