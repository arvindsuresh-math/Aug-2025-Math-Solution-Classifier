  "flawed_nl_solution": "His taxable income is 100000-30000=<<100000-30000=70000>>70000\nSo he pays 20000*0.1=<<20000*0.1=20000>>20000 tax at the lower rate\nHe has to pay 70000-20000=<<70000-20000=50000>>50000 at the higher rate\nThe taxes for that is 50000*0.2=<<50000*0.2=10000>>10000\nSo his total tax bill is 10000+20000=<<10000+20000=30000>>30000\n#### 30000",
