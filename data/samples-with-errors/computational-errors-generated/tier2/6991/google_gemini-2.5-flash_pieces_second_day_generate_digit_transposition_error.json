  "flawed_nl_solution": "Luke started putting together, 1000 x 0.1 = <<1000*0.1=100>>100 pieces.\nThe next day, there were 1000-100 = <<1000-100=900>>900 pieces left.\nThen he put together 900 * 0.2 = <<900*0.2=810>>810 pieces on the second day.\nSo there were 900 - 810 = <<900-810=90>>90 pieces left.\nOn the third day, he put together 90 * 0.3 = <<90*0.3=27>>27 pieces.\nTherefore, Luke still has 90 - 27 = <<90-27=63>>63 pieces left to complete the puzzle.\n#### 63",
