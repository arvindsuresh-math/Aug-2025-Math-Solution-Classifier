  "flawed_nl_solution": "Luke started putting together, 1000 x 0.1 = <<1000*0.1=100>>100 pieces.\nThe next day, there were 1000-100 = <<1000-100=9000>>9000 pieces left.\nThen he put together 9000 * 0.2 = <<9000*0.2=1800>>1800 pieces on the second day.\nSo there were 9000 - 1800 = <<9000-1800=7200>>7200 pieces left.\nOn the third day, he put together 7200 * 0.3 = <<7200*0.3=2160>>2160 pieces.\nTherefore, Luke still has 7200 - 2160 = <<7200-2160=5040>>5040 pieces left to complete the puzzle.\n#### 5040",
