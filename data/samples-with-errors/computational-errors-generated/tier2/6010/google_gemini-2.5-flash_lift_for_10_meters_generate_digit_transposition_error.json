  "flawed_nl_solution": "After the increase, he can lift 300+50=<<300+50=350>>350 pounds\nDecreasing the distance increase the amount he can lift by 350*0.3=<<350*0.3=105>>105 pounds\nSo he can lift 350+105=<<350+105=545>>545 for 10 feet\nThe straps add another 545*0.2=<<545*0.2=109>>109 pounds\nSo his total weight is 545+109=<<545+109=654>>654 pounds per hand\n#### 654",
