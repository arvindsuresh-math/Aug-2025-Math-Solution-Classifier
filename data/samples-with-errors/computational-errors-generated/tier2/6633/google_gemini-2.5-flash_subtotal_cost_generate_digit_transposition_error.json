  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants which cost 110x4= $<<110*4=440>>440.\nAnd he also wants to buy 2 pairs of socks that cost 60x2= $<<60*2=120>>120.\nThe total amount he needs to spend without the discount is 440+120= $<<440+120=650>>650.\nThe discount he will have amounts to $650x.0.3= $195.\nSo the total amount he needs to spend after deducting the discount from the total amount is 650-195=$<<650-195=455>>455.\n#### 455",
