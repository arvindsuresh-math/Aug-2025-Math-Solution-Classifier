  "flawed_nl_solution": "Daniel filled 11 * 6 = <<11*6=66>>66 bottles for the football team.\nHe filled 66 + 12 = <<66+12=79>>79 bottles for the lacrosse team.\nHe got water bottles for four teams, so the team coaches wanted 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 bottles.\nIn all, he filled 66 + 53 + 79 + 8 + R = R + 206 = 254 bottles in all.\nThus, he filled R = 254 - 206 = <<254-206=48>>48 bottles for the rugby team this season.\n#### 48",
