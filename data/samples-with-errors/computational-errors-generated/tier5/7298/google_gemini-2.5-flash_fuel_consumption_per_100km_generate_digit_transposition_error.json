  "flawed_nl_solution": "The car consumed 47 liters - 14 liters = <<47-14=33>>33 liters of gasoline for 275 km.\nLet x be the fuel consumption per 100 km. We can write the proportion: 33/275 = x/100\nThe cross product gives: 275 x = 33 * 100\nSo the car consumes x = 3300/275 = <<3300/275=21>>21 liters per 100 km.\n#### 21",
