  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the business's stock price rises 30%, then his share on the company is worth 30% multiplied by $2000 plus $2000 that he already had. That results in 30% * $2000 + $2000 = $600 + $2000 = $<<30*0.01*2000+2000=2603>>2603.\nSince he already had $300, with $2603 more he will have $300 + $2603 = $<<300+2603=2903>>2903.\n#### 2903",
