  "flawed_nl_solution": "William used two days to the limit, which means 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours of horse riding.\nFor two days he rode a horse 1.5 a day, which makes up to 1.5 * 2 = <<1.5*2=3.0>>3.0 hours.\nFor the next two days, he used only half of the maximum time which means 6 * 0.5 = <<6*0.5=3.0>>3.0 hours a day.\nThat means 2 * 3.0 = <<2*3.0=6.0>>6.0 hours during these two days.\nSo in total William rode his horse for 12 + 3.0 + 6.0 = <<12+3.0+6.0=12.0>>12.0 hours.",
