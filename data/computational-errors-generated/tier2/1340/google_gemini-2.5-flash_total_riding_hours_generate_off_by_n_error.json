  "flawed_nl_solution": "William used two days to the limit, which means 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours of horse riding.\nFor two days he rode a horse 1.5 a day, which makes up to 1.5 * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 hours.\nFor the next two days, he used only half of the maximum time which means 6 * 0.5 = <<6*0.5=3>>3 hours a day.\nThat means 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours during these two days.\nSo in total William rode his horse for 12 + 3 + 6 = <<12+3+6=18>>18 hours.\n#### 18",
