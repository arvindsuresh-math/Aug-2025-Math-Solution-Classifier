  "flawed_nl_solution": "The adult tickets cost $4.25 + $3.25 = $<<4.25+3.25=7.5>>7.5.\nSo two adult tickets cost $7.5 x 2 = $<<7.5*2=15>>15.\nFour children's tickets cost $4.25 x 4 = $<<4*4.25=71>>71.\nSo the total cost of all the tickets amounted to $15 + $71 = $<<15+71=86>>86.\nThe family had a discount, so they paid a total of $86 - $2 = $<<86-2=84>>84.\n#### 84",
