  "flawed_nl_solution": "The adult tickets cost $4.25 + $3.25 = $<<4.25+3.25=7.5>>7.5.\nSo 2 adult tickets cost $7.5 x 2 = $<<7.5*2=15.0>>15.0.\nFour children's tickets cost $4.25 x 4 = $<<4*4.25=71.0>>71.0.\nSo the total cost of all the tickets amounted to $15.0 + $71.0 = $<<15.0+71.0=86.0>>86.0.\nThe family had a discount, so they paid a total of $86.0 - $2 = $<<86.0-2=84.0>>84.0.",
