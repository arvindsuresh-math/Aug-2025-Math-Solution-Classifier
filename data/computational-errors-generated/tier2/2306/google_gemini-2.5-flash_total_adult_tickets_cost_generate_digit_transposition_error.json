  "flawed_nl_solution": "The adult tickets cost $4.25 + $3.25 = $<<4.25+3.25=7.5>>7.5.\nSo 2 adult tickets cost $7.5 x 2 = $<<7.5*2=51>>51.\nFour children's tickets cost $4.25 x 4 = $<<4*4.25=17>>17.\nSo the total cost of all the tickets amounted to $51 + $17 = $<<51+17=68>>68.\nThe family had a discount, so they paid a total of $68 - $2 = $<<68-2=66>>66.\n#### 66",
