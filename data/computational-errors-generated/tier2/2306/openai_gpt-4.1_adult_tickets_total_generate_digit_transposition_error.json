  "flawed_nl_solution": "The adult tickets cost $4.25 + $3.25 = $<<4.25+3.25=7.5>>7.5.\nSo two adult tickets cost $7.5 x 2 = $<<7.5*2=51.0>>51.0.\nFour children's tickets cost $4.25 x 4 = $<<4*4.25=17.0>>17.0.\nSo the total cost of all the tickets amounted to $51.0 + $17.0 = $<<51.0+17.0=68.0>>68.0.\nThe family had a discount, so they paid a total of $68.0 - $2 = $<<68.0-2=66.0>>66.0.",
