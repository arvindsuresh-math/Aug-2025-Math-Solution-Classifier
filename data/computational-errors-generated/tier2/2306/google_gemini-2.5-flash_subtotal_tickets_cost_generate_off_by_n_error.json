  "flawed_nl_solution": "The adult tickets cost $4.25 + $3.25 = $<<4.25+3.25=7.5>>7.5.\nSo 2 adult tickets cost $7.5 x 2 = $<<7.5*2=15>>15.\nFour children's tickets cost $4.25 x 4 = $<<4*4.25=17>>17.\nSo the total cost of all the tickets amounted to $15 + $17 = $<<15+17=34>>34.\nThe family had a discount, so they paid a total of $34 - $2 = $<<34-2=32>>32.\n#### 32",
