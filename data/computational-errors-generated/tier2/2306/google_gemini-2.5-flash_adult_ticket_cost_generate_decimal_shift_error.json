  "flawed_nl_solution": "The adult tickets cost $4.25 + $3.25 = $<<4.25+3.25=75.0>>75.0.\nSo 2 adult tickets cost $75.0 x 2 = $<<75.0*2=150.0>>150.0.\nFour children's tickets cost $4.25 x 4 = $<<4*4.25=17.0>>17.0.\nSo the total cost of all the tickets amounted to $150.0 + $17.0 = $<<150.0+17.0=167.0>>167.0.\nThe family had a discount, so they paid a total of $167.0 - $2 = $<<167.0-2=165.0>>165.0.",
