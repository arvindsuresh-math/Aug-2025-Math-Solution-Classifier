  "flawed_nl_solution": "The adult tickets cost $4.25 + $3.25 = $<<4.25+3.25=7.5>>7.5.\nSo 2 adult tickets cost $7.5 x 2 = $<<7.5*2=15.0>>15.0.\nFour children's tickets cost $4.25 x 4 = $<<4*4.25=17.0>>17.0.\nSo the total cost of all the tickets amounted to $15.0 + $17.0 = $<<15.0+17.0=23.0>>23.0.\nThe family had a discount, so they paid a total of $23.0 - $2 = $<<23.0-2=21.0>>21.0.",
