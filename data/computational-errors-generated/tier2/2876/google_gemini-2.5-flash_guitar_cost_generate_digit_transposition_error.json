  "flawed_nl_solution": "The guitar costs $100.0 every month for 12 months so it costs 100.0*12 = $<<100.0*12=2100.0>>2100.0\nHis dad is charging him 10% interest on the $2100.0 so interest comes to 0.1*2100.0 = $<<2100.0*0.1=210.0>>210.0\nAll total, Aaron will owe his father the price of the guitar, $2100.0 and the interest, $210.0 so 2100.0+210.0 = $<<2100.0+210.0=2310.0>>2310.0",
