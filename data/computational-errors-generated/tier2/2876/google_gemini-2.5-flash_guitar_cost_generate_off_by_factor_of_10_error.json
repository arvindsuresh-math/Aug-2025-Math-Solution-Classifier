  "flawed_nl_solution": "The guitar costs $100.0 every month for 12 months so it costs 100.0*12 = $<<100.0*12=120.0>>120.0\nHis dad is charging him 10% interest on the $120.0 so interest comes to 0.1*120.0 = $<<120.0*0.1=12.0>>12.0\nAll total, Aaron will owe his father the price of the guitar, $120.0 and the interest, $12.0 so 120.0+12.0 = $<<120.0+12.0=132.0>>132.0",
