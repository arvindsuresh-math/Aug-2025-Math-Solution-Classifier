  "flawed_nl_solution": "It took 8*0.25=<<8*0.25=2>>2 years longer to go from chief to master chief than to get chief\nSo it takes him 8+2=<<8+2=10>>10 years to become a master chief\nThat means he took 10+8=<<10+8=18>>18 years to reach master chief from enlisting\nSo he was in the military for 18+10=<<18+10=27>>27 years\nSo he was 27+18=<<27+18=45>>45 when he retired\n#### 45",
