  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first shirt has no (0%) discount off the regular price ($10), therefore your discount is = 0% * $10 = $<<0*0.01*10=0>>0\nThe second shirt has a 50% discount off the regular price ($10), therefore your discount is = 50% * $10 = $<<50*0.01*10=5>>5\nThe third shirt has a 60% discount of the regular price ($10), therefore your discount is = 60% * $10 = $<<60*0.01*10=6>>6\nTherefore in total, you save $0 on the first shirt, $5 on the second one and $6 on the third one = 0+5+6 = $<<0+5+6=12>>12\n#### 12",
