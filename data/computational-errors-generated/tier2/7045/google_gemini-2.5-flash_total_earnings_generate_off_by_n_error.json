  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jackson spent a total of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours vacuuming.\nThis means he earned 4 * $5 = <<4*5=20>>20 dollars from vacuuming.\nHe earned 0.5 * $5 = <<0.5*5=2.5>>2.5 dollars from washing dishes.\nCleaning the bathroom took three times as long as the dishes, so he spent 0.5 * 3 = <<0.5*3=1.5>>1.5 hours in the bathroom.\nThis means he earned 1.5 * $5 = $<<1.5*5=7.5>>7.5 from cleaning the bathroom.\nIn total, he has earned $20 + $2.5 + $7.5 = $<<20+2.5+7.5=25>>25.\n#### 25",
