  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much money the ex made during the first 3 years by multiplying his annual earnings by the number of years: 3 years * $30000/year = $<<3*30000=90000>>90000/\nThen find how much his raise was by multiplying his salary by the percentage raise: $30000/year * 20% = $<<30000*20*0.01=60000>>60000/year\nThen add the raise to his original salary to find his new salary: $60000/year + $30000/year = $<<60000+30000=90000>>90000/year\nThen find how much he made working at the new salary by multiplying it by the 4 years he worked: 4 years * $90000/year = $<<4*90000=360000>>360000\nAdd his earnings from the three years and the four years to find his total earnings: $360000 + $90000 = $<<360000+90000=450000>>450000\nNow multiply his total earnings by 30% to find how much he was supposed to pay: $450000 * 30% = $<<450000*30*0.01=135000>>135000\nNow subtract the amount he paid from this number to find how much he owes: $135000 - $1200 = $<<135000-1200=133800>>133800\n#### 133800",
