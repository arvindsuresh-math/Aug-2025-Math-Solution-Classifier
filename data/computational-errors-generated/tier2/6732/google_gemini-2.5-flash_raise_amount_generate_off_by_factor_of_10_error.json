  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much money the ex made during the first 3 years by multiplying his annual earnings by the number of years: 3 years * $30000/year = $<<3*30000=90000>>90000/\nThen find how much his raise was by multiplying his salary by the percentage raise: $30000/year * 20% = $<<30000*20*0.01=600>>600/year\nThen add the raise to his original salary to find his new salary: $600/year + $30000/year = $<<600+30000=30600>>30600/year\nThen find how much he made working at the new salary by multiplying it by the 4 years he worked: 4 years * $30600/year = $<<4*30600=122400>>122400\nAdd his earnings from the three years and the four years to find his total earnings: $122400 + $90000 = $<<122400+90000=212400>>212400\nNow multiply his total earnings by 30% to find how much he was supposed to pay: $212400 * 30% = $<<212400*30*0.01=63720>>63720\nNow subtract the amount he paid from this number to find how much he owes: $63720 - $1200 = $<<63720-1200=62520>>62520\n#### 62520",
