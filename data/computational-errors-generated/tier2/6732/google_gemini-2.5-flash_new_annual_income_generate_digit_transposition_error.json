  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much money the ex made during the first 3 years by multiplying his annual earnings by the number of years: 3 years * $30000/year = $<<3*30000=90000>>90000/\nThen find how much his raise was by multiplying his salary by the percentage raise: $30000/year * 20% = $<<30000*20*0.01=6000>>6000/year\nThen add the raise to his original salary to find his new salary: $6000/year + $30000/year = $<<6000+30000=63000>>63000/year\nThen find how much he made working at the new salary by multiplying it by the 4 years he worked: 4 years * $63000/year = $<<4*63000=252000>>252000\nAdd his earnings from the three years and the four years to find his total earnings: $252000 + $90000 = $<<252000+90000=342000>>342000\nNow multiply his total earnings by 30% to find how much he was supposed to pay: $342000 * 30% = $<<342000*30*0.01=102600>>102600\nNow subtract the amount he paid from this number to find how much he owes: $102600 - $1200 = $<<102600-1200=101400>>101400\n#### 101400",
