  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants which cost 110x4= $<<110*4=440>>440.\nAnd he also wants to buy 2 pairs of socks that cost 60x2= $<<60*2=120>>120.\nThe total amount he needs to spend without the discount is 440+120= $<<440+120=530>>530.\nThe discount he will have amounts to $530x.0.3= $159.\nSo the total amount he needs to spend after deducting the discount from the total amount is 530-159=$<<530-159=371>>371.\n#### 371",
