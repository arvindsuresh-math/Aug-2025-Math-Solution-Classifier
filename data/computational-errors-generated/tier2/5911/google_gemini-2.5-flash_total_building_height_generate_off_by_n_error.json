  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 floors that are each 3 meters high.\nSo the first 18 floors is 18 x 3 = <<18*3=54>>54 meters high.\nThe last two floors are each 3 + 0.5 = <<3+0.5=3.5>>3.5 meters high.\nSo the total height of the last two floors is 3.5 x 2 = <<3.5*2=7>>7 meters.\nTherefore, the building is 54 + 7 = <<54+7=62>>62 meters high.\n#### 62",
