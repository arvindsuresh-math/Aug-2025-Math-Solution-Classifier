  "flawed_nl_solution": "Book 1 was $12.50 and book 2 was $15.00 so 13 +15 = $28\nHe was buying 4 books, so these 2 were 25% off so 28 * 0.25 = $7\nThese two books came out to 28-7 = $<<28-7=21>>21\nBooks 3 & 4 were both $10 each so 2*10 = $20\nWhen you add all 4 books together, 21+20 = $<<21+20=14>>14\nTo get free shipping he would need to spend 50-14 = $<<50-14=36>>36 more on books",
