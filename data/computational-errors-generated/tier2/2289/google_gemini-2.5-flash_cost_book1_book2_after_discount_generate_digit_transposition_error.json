  "flawed_nl_solution": "Book 1 was $12.50 and book 2 was $15.00 so 13.0 +15.0 = $28.0\nHe was buying 4 books, so these 2 were 25% off so 28.0 * 0.25 = $7.0\nThese two books came out to 28.0-7.0 = $<<28.0-7.0=12.0>>12.0\nBooks 3 & 4 were both $10.0 each so 2*10.0 = $20.0\nWhen you add all 4 books together, 12.0+20.0 = $<<12.0+20.0=32.0>>32.0\nTo get free shipping he would need to spend 50.0-32.0 = $<<50.0-32.0=18.0>>18.0 more on books",
