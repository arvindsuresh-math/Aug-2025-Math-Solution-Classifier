  "flawed_nl_solution": "Book 1 was $12.50 and book 2 was $15.00 so 13.0 +15.0 = $32.0\nHe was buying 4 books, so these 2 were 25% off so 32.0 * 0.25 = $8.0\nThese two books came out to 32.0-8.0 = $<<32.0-8.0=24.0>>24.0\nBooks 3 & 4 were both $10.0 each so 2*10.0 = $20.0\nWhen you add all 4 books together, 24.0+20.0 = $<<24.0+20.0=44.0>>44.0\nTo get free shipping he would need to spend 50.0-44.0 = $<<50.0-44.0=6.0>>6.0 more on books",
