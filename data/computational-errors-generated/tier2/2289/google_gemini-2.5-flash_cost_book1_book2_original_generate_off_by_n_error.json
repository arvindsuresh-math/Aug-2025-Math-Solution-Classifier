  "flawed_nl_solution": "Book 1 was $12.50 and book 2 was $15.00 so 13 +15 = $32\nHe was buying 4 books, so these 2 were 25% off so 32 * 0.25 = $8\nThese two books came out to 32-8 = $<<32-8=24>>24\nBooks 3 & 4 were both $10 each so 2*10 = $20\nWhen you add all 4 books together, 24+20 = $<<24+20=44>>44\nTo get free shipping he would need to spend 50-44 = $<<50-44=6>>6 more on books",
