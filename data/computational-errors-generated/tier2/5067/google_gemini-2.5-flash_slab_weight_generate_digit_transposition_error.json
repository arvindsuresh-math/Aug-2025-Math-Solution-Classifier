  "flawed_nl_solution": "The volume of the slab is 100*100*0.5=<<100*100*0.5=5000>>5000 cubic feet\nSo it weighs 5000*150=<<5000*150=705000>>705000 pounds\nThat means the cost is 705000*$0.02=$<<705000*0.02=14100>>14100 per house\nSo the total cost for all 3 houses is $14100*3=$<<14100*3=42300>>42300\n#### 42300",
