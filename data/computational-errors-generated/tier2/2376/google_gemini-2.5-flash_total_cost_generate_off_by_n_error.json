  "flawed_nl_solution": "She orders 2 scoops of ice cream that's $1 per scoop so the ice cream costs 2*1 = $<<2*1=2>>2.\nShe wants double syrup. The syrup is $0.5 so that will cost 2*0.5 = $<<2*0.5=1>>1.\nThe brownie is $2.5, the ice cream will be $2, the syrup will be $1 and the nuts will be $1.5 bringing her total to 2.5+2+1+1.5 = $<<2.5+2+1+1.5=12>>12.\n#### 12",
