  "flawed_nl_solution": "From 2pm to 4pm is 4-2=7 hours.\nThus, from 2-4pm, raining at 4 inches per hour, it added 28 inches to the rain gauge.\nFrom 4pm to 7pm is 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 hours.\nThus, from 4-7pm, raining at a rate of 3 inches per hour, it added 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 inches to the rain gauge.\nFrom 7pm to 9pm is 9-7=<<9-7=2>>2 hours.\nThus, from 7-9pm, raining at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour, it added 2*0.5=1 inch to the gauge.\nIf the gauge originally contained 2 inches of water, by 9pm the gauge contained 2+28+9+1=<<2+28+9+1=40>>40 inches of water.\n#### 40",
