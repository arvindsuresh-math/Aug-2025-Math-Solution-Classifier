  "flawed_nl_solution": "Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 kilometers.\nTwo years is 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = <<24*0.5=21.0>>21.0 months.\nSo in 21.0 months Nina does 400 * 21.0 = <<400*21.0=8400.0>>8400.0 kilometers.\nAnd in the other 21.0 months, she does 800 * 21.0 = <<800*21.0=16800.0>>16800.0 kilometers.\nSo in two years, Nina would be able to make 8400.0 + 16800.0 = <<8400.0+16800.0=25200.0>>25200.0 kilometers.",
