  "flawed_nl_solution": "Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 kilometers.\nTwo years is 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = <<24*0.5=12>>12 months.\nSo in 12 months Nina does 400 * 12 = <<400*12=4080>>4080 kilometers.\nAnd in the other 12 months, she does 800 * 12 = <<800*12=9600>>9600 kilometers.\nSo in two years, Nina would be able to make 4080 + 9600 = <<4080+9600=13680>>13680 kilometers.",
