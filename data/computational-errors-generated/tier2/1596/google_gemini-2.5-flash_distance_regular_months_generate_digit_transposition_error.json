  "flawed_nl_solution": "Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 kilometers.\nTwo years is 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = <<24*0.5=12.0>>12.0 months.\nSo in 12.0 months Nina does 400 * 12.0 = <<400*12.0=4080.0>>4080.0 kilometers.\nAnd in the other 12.0 months, she does 800 * 12.0 = <<800*12.0=9600.0>>9600.0 kilometers.\nSo in two years, Nina would be able to make 4080.0 + 9600.0 = <<4080.0+9600.0=13680.0>>13680.0 kilometers.",
