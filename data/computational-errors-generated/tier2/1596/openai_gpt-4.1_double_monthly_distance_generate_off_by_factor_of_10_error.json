  "flawed_nl_solution": "Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = <<400*2=80>>80 kilometers.\nTwo years is 2 * 12 = 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = <<24*0.5=12.0>>12.0 months.\nSo in 12.0 months Nina does 400 * 12.0 = <<400*12.0=4800.0>>4800.0 kilometers.\nAnd in the other 12.0 months, she does 80 * 12.0 = <<80*12.0=960.0>>960.0 kilometers.\nSo in two years, Nina would be able to make 4800.0 + 960.0 = <<4800.0+960.0=5760.0>>5760.0 kilometers.",
