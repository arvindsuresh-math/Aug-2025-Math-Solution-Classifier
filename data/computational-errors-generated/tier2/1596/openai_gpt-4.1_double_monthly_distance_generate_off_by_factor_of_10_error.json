  "flawed_nl_solution": "Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = <<400*2=8000>>8000 kilometers.\nTwo years is 2 * 12 = 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = <<24*0.5=12>>12 months.\nSo in 12 months Nina does 400 * 12 = <<400*12=4800>>4800 kilometers.\nAnd in the other 12 months, she does 8000 * 12 = <<8000*12=96000>>96000 kilometers.\nSo in two years, Nina would be able to make 4800 + 96000 = <<4800+96000=100800>>100800 kilometers.",
