  "flawed_nl_solution": "After the increase, he can lift 300+50=<<300+50=350>>350 pounds\nDecreasing the distance increase the amount he can lift by 350*0.3=<<350*0.3=150>>150 pounds\nSo he can lift 350+150=<<350+150=500>>500 for 10 feet\nThe straps add another 500*0.2=<<500*0.2=100>>100 pounds\nSo his total weight is 500+100=<<500+100=600>>600 pounds per hand\n#### 600",
