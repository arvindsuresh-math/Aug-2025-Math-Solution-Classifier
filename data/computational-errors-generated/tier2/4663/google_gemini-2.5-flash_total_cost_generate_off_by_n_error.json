  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Deane will spend $1.4/liter x 10 liters = $<<1.4*10=14>>14 for the 10 liters of gas today.\nThe price of the gas per liter on Friday will be $1.4/liter - $0.4/liter = $<<1.4-0.4=1>>1/liter.\nSo, he will spend $1/liter x 25 liters = $<<1*25=25>>25 for the 25 liters of gas on Friday.\nThus, Mr. Deane will spend a total of $14 + $25 = $<<14+25=44>>44 for the 35 liters of gas.\n#### 44",
