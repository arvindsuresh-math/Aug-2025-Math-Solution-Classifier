  "flawed_nl_solution": "Diane made 1000*15= $<<1000*15=150000>>150000 in sales because she had 1000 customers each buy a $15 book.\n37% of those customers returned their books, so that means she had 0.37*1000= <<37*0.01*1000=370>>370 returns\nEach of those returns was for a $15 book, so she had 370*15= $<<370*15=5550>>5550 in returns\nFor her total leftover income, we subtract the returns from the sales and end up with 150000-5550= $<<150000-5550=144450>>144450 in income.\n#### 144450",
