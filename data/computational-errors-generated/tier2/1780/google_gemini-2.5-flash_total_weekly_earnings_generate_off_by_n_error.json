  "flawed_nl_solution": "Faith earns $13.5 x 8 = $<<13.5*8=108>>108 per day.\nSince she works 5 days a week, she earns 5 x $108 = $<<5*108=540>>540 per week.\nShe gets an additional 2 x $13.5 = $<<2*13.5=27>>27 per day for the overtime pay.\nShe earns a total of $27 x 5 = $<<27*5=135>>135 additional pay for her weekly overtime.\nTherefore, Faith earns $540 + $135 = $<<540+135=679>>679 per week.\n#### 679",
