  "flawed_nl_solution": "Faith earns $13.5 x 8 = $<<13.5*8=108.0>>108.0 per day.\nSince she works 5 days a week, she earns 5 x $108.0 = $<<5*108.0=540.0>>540.0 per week.\nShe gets an additional 2 x $13.5 = $<<2*13.5=27.0>>27.0 per day for the overtime pay.\nShe earns a total of $27.0 x 5 = $<<27.0*5=315.0>>315.0 additional pay for her weekly overtime.\nTherefore, Faith earns $540.0 + $315.0 = $<<540.0+315.0=855.0>>855.0 per week.",
