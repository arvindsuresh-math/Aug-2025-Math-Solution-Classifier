  "flawed_nl_solution": "Faith earns $13.5 x 8 = $<<13.5*8=180.0>>180.0 per day.\nSince she works 5 days a week, she earns 5 x $180.0 = $<<5*180.0=900.0>>900.0 per week.\nShe gets an additional 2 x $13.5 = $<<2*13.5=27.0>>27.0 per day for the overtime pay.\nShe earns a total of $27.0 x 5 = $<<27.0*5=135.0>>135.0 additional pay for her weekly overtime.\nTherefore, Faith earns $900.0 + $135.0 = $<<900.0+135.0=1035.0>>1035.0 per week.",
