  "flawed_nl_solution": "Faith earns $13.5 x 8 = $<<13.5*8=108.0>>108.0 per day.\nSince she works 5 days a week, she earns 5 x $108.0 = $<<5*108.0=540.0>>540.0 per week.\nShe gets an additional 2 x $13.5 = $<<2*13.5=72.0>>72.0 per day for the overtime pay.\nShe earns a total of $72.0 x 5 = $<<72.0*5=360.0>>360.0 additional pay for her weekly overtime.\nTherefore, Faith earns $540.0 + $360.0 = $<<540.0+360.0=900.0>>900.0 per week.",
