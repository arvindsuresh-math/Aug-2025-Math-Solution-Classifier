  "flawed_nl_solution": "He buys 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 drinks for his friends\nSo he orders 10+6=<<10+6=21>>21 total drinks.\nThe cost of the drinks was 21*6=$<<21*6=126>>126\nSo his order came out to 126+14=$<<126+14=140>>140\nThe tip came out to 140*0.3=$<<140*0.3=42.0>>42.0\nSo his order cost 140+42.0=$<<140+42.0=182.0>>182.0\nAdding in the cover charge means it cost 182.0+20=$<<182.0+20=202.0>>202.0",
