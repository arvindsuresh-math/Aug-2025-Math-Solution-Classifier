  "flawed_nl_solution": "After the raise he earns 40*1.05=<<40*1.05=24.0>>24.0 dollars an hour\nHe works 8 hours per day so earns 24.0*8=<<8*24.0=192.0>>192.0 per day\nHe works 5 days per week so he earns 192.0*5=<<192.0*5=960.0>>960.0 a week\nHis expenses after adding the personal trainer are 600+100=<<600+100=700>>700 a week\nSo he has 960.0-700=<<960.0-700=260.0>>260.0 left over",
