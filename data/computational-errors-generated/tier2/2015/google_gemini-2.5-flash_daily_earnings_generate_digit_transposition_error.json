  "flawed_nl_solution": "After the raise he earns 40*1.05=<<40*1.05=42.0>>42.0 dollars an hour\nHe works 8 hours per day so earns 42.0*8=<<8*42.0=363.0>>363.0 per day\nHe works 5 days per week so he earns 363.0*5=<<363.0*5=1815.0>>1815.0 a week\nHis expenses after adding the personal trainer are 600+100=<<600+100=700>>700 a week\nSo he has 1815.0-700=<<1815.0-700=1115.0>>1115.0 left over",
