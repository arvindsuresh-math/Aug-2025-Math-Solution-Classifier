  "flawed_nl_solution": "After the raise he earns 40*1.05=<<40*1.05=42.0>>42.0 dollars an hour\nHe works 8 hours per day so earns 42.0*8=<<8*42.0=336.0>>336.0 per day\nHe works 5 days per week so he earns 336.0*5=<<336.0*5=1680.0>>1680.0 a week\nHis expenses after adding the personal trainer are 600+100=<<600+100=700>>700 a week\nSo he has 1680.0-700=<<1680.0-700=985.0>>985.0 left over",
