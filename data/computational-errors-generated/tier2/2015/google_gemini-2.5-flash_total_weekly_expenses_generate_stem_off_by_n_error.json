  "flawed_nl_solution": "After the raise he earns 40*1.05=<<40*1.05=42>>42 dollars an hour\nHe works 8 hours per day so earns 42*8=<<8*42=336>>336 per day\nHe works 5 days per week so he earns 336*5=<<336*5=1680>>1680 a week\nHis expenses after adding the personal trainer are 600+100=<<600+100=670>>670 a week\nSo he has 1680-670=<<1680-670=1010>>1010 left over",
