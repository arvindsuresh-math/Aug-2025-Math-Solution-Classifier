  "flawed_nl_solution": "Yanni's mother gave him $0.4 in addition to $0.85 for a total of $0.4+$0.85 = $<<0.4+0.85=1.25>>1.25.\nYanni found $0.5 so he had a total of $1.25 + $0.5 = $<<1.25+0.5=17.5>>17.5\nTherefore, Yanni had $17.5 - $1.6 = $<<17.5-1.6=15.9>>15.9 left\n100 cents make $1 so $15.9 is 100*15.9 = <<100*15.9=1590>>1590 cents\n#### 1590",
