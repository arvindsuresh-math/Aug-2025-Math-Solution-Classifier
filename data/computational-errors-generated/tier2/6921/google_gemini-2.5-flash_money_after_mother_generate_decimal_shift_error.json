  "flawed_nl_solution": "Yanni's mother gave him $0.4 in addition to $0.85 for a total of $0.4+$0.85 = $<<0.4+0.85=12.5>>12.5.\nYanni found $0.5 so he had a total of $12.5 + $0.5 = $<<12.5+0.5=13>>13\nTherefore, Yanni had $13 - $1.6 = $<<13-1.6=11.4>>11.4 left\n100 cents make $1 so $11.4 is 100*11.4 = <<100*11.4=1140>>1140 cents\n#### 1140",
