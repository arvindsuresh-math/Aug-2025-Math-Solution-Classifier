  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much more Jerry charges to pierce one person's ears than their nose: $20 * 50% = $<<20*50*0.01=10>>10\nThen add that amount to the cost of nose piercing to find the total cost: $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30\nThen multiply that price by the number of ears he pierces to find his total earnings from ear-piercing: $30/ear * 9 ears = $<<30*9=270>>270\nThen multiply the price of nose-piercing by the number of noses pierced: $20/nose * 6 noses = $<<20*6=210>>210\nThen add the money from nose-piercing to the money from ear-piercing to find Jerry's total income: $210 + $270 = $<<210+270=480>>480\n#### 480",
