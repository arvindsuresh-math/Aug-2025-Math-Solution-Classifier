  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much more Jerry charges to pierce one person's ears than their nose: $20 * 50% = $<<20*50*0.01=10>>10\nThen add that amount to the cost of nose piercing to find the total cost: $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=35>>35\nThen multiply that price by the number of ears he pierces to find his total earnings from ear-piercing: $35/ear * 9 ears = $<<35*9=315>>315\nThen multiply the price of nose-piercing by the number of noses pierced: $20/nose * 6 noses = $<<20*6=120>>120\nThen add the money from nose-piercing to the money from ear-piercing to find Jerry's total income: $120 + $315 = $<<120+315=435>>435\n#### 435",
