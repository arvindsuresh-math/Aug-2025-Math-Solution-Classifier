  "flawed_nl_solution": "Alex traveled at 20 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so 20 * 4.5 = <<20*4.5=90>>90 miles on flat ground.\nHe traveled 12 miles per hour uphill for 2.5 hours, so 12 * 2.5 = <<12*2.5=30>>30 miles uphill.\nHe traveled downhill 24 miles per hour for 1.5 hours = 24 * 1.5 = <<24*1.5=36>>36 miles downhill.\nBefore his tire punctured, he traveled 90 + 30 + 36 = <<90+30+36=156>>156 miles.\nSo as the next town is 164 miles from where he began, Alex had to walk for 164 - 156 = <<164-156=4>>4 miles.\n#### 4",
