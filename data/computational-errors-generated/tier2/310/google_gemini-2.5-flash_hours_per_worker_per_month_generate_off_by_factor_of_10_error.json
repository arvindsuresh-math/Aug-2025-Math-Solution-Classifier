  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = <<25*8=20>>20 hours\nThen calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 20 hours * $15/hour = $<<20*15=300>>300\nThen multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $300/worker * 4 workers = $<<300*4=1200>>1200\nNow multiply the hours each manager works (also 20) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 20 hours * $20/hour = $<<20*20=400>>400\nNow multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $400/manager * 2 managers = $<<400*2=800>>800\nNow add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $800 + $1200 = $<<800+1200=2000>>2000\nNow multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $2000 * 0.1 = $<<2000*0.1=200>>200\nNow add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $200 + $2000 = $<<200+2000=2200>>2200",
