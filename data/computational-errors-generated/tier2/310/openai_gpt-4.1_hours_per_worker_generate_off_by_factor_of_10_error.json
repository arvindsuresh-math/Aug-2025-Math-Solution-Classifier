  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = <<25*8=2000>>2000 hours\nThen calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30000\nThen multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $30000/worker * 4 workers = $<<30000*4=120000>>120000\nNow multiply the hours each manager works (also 2000) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 2000 hours * $20/hour = $<<2000*20=40000>>40000\nNow multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $40000/manager * 2 managers = $<<40000*2=80000>>80000\nNow add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $80000 + $120000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200000\nNow multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $200000 * 0.1 = $<<200000*0.1=20000>>20000\nNow add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $20000 + $200000 = $<<20000+200000=220000>>220000\n#### 220000",
