  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = <<25*8=200>>200 hours\nThen calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15/hour = $<<200*15=3000>>3000\nThen multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $<<3000*4=120000>>120000\nNow multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20/hour = $<<200*20=4000>>4000\nNow multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4000/manager * 2 managers = $<<4000*2=8000>>8000\nNow add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8000 + $120000 = $<<8000+120000=128000>>128000\nNow multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $128000 * 0.1 = $<<128000*0.1=12800.0>>12800.0\nNow add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $12800.0 + $128000 = $<<12800.0+128000=140800.0>>140800.0",
