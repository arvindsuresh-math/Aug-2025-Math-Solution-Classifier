  "flawed_nl_solution": "Uki earns 20 x $1.5 = $<<20*1.5=30>>30 in selling 20 cupcakes.\nShe earns 10 x $2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 for selling 10 packets of cookies,\nAdditionally, she earns another 20 x $1 = $<<20*1=20>>20 for selling twenty packets of biscuits.\nThus, in a day, she earns an average of $30 + $20 + $20 = $70. Therefore, for 5 days, Uki earns 5 x $70 = $<<5*70=530>>530. \"\n#### 530",
