  "flawed_nl_solution": "He does the long drive 7-4=<<7-4=1>>1 days a week\nSo he drives a total of 4*50+1*100=<<4*50+1*100=300>>300 miles a week\nThat means the car cost 300*0.1=$<<300*0.1=30.0>>30.0 just for the mileage per week\nSo he pays 100+30.0=$<<100+30.0=130.0>>130.0 per week for the car\nThat means the total cost of the car is 130.0*52=$<<130.0*52=6760.0>>6760.0 a year",
