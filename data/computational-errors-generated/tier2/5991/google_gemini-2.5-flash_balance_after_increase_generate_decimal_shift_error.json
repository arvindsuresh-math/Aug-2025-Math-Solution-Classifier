  "flawed_nl_solution": "Megan started with $125 and increased it by 25%, so $125 + (0.25)125 or $125 + $31.25 = $<<125+31.25=1562.5>>1562.5.\nThen the balance decreased by 20%, so $1562.5 - (0.2)1562.5 or $1562.5 - $312.5 = $<<1562.5-312.5=1250>>1250.\n$125 is the balance Megan started with, so her final balance is 1000% of the starting balance.\n#### 1000",
