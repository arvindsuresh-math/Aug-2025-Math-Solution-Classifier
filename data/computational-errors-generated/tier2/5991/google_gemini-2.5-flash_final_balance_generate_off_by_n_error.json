  "flawed_nl_solution": "Megan started with $125 and increased it by 25%, so $125 + (0.25)125 or $125 + $31.25 = $<<125+31.25=156.25>>156.25.\nThen the balance decreased by 20%, so $156.25 - (0.2)156.25 or $156.25 - $31.25 = $<<156.25-31.25=130>>130.\n$125 is the balance Megan started with, so her final balance is 104% of the starting balance.\n#### 104",
