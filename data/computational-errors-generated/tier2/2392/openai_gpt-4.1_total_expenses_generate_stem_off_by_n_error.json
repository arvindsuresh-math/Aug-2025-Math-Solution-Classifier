  "flawed_nl_solution": "He sells each computer for 1.4*800=$<<1.4*800=1120.0>>1120.0\nThat means he makes a profit of 1120.0-800=$<<1120.0-800=320.0>>320.0 per computer\nSo he makes 320.0*60=$<<320.0*60=19200.0>>19200.0 from selling computers\nHe has extra expenses of 5000+3000=$<<5000+3000=7990>>7990 a month\nSo his profit is 19200.0-7990=$<<19200.0-7990=11210.0>>11210.0",
