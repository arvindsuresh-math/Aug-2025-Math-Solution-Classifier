  "flawed_nl_solution": "He sells each computer for 1.4*800=$<<1.4*800=1102.0>>1102.0\nThat means he makes a profit of 1102.0-800=$<<1102.0-800=302.0>>302.0 per computer\nSo he makes 302.0*60=$<<302.0*60=18120.0>>18120.0 from selling computers\nHe has extra expenses of 5000+3000=$<<5000+3000=8000>>8000 a month\nSo his profit is 18120.0-8000=$<<18120.0-8000=10120.0>>10120.0",
