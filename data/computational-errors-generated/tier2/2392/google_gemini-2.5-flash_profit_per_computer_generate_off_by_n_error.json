  "flawed_nl_solution": "He sells each computer for 1.4*800=$<<1.4*800=1120.0>>1120.0\nThat means he makes a profit of 1120.0-800=$<<1120.0-800=315.0>>315.0 per computer\nSo he makes 315.0*60=$<<315.0*60=18900.0>>18900.0 from selling computers\nHe has extra expenses of 5000+3000=$<<5000+3000=8000>>8000 a month\nSo his profit is 18900.0-8000=$<<18900.0-8000=10900.0>>10900.0",
