  "flawed_nl_solution": "He sells each computer for 1.4*800=$<<1.4*800=1120.0>>1120.0\nThat means he makes a profit of 1120.0-800=$<<1120.0-800=320.0>>320.0 per computer\nSo he makes 320.0*60=$<<320.0*60=91200.0>>91200.0 from selling computers\nHe has extra expenses of 5000+3000=$<<5000+3000=8000>>8000 a month\nSo his profit is 91200.0-8000=$<<91200.0-8000=83200.0>>83200.0",
