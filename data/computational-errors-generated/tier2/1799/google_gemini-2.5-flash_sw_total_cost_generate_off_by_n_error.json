  "flawed_nl_solution": "The discount saved when buying from Guitar Center would be $1000 * 15% = $<<1000*15*0.01=150>>150.\nThe total cost when buying from Guitar Center would be $1000 - $150 discount + $100 shipping = $950.\nThe discount when buying from Sweetwater would be $1000 * 10% = $<<1000*10*0.01=100>>100.\nThe total cost when buying from Sweetwater would be $1000 - $100 discount + $0 shipping = $<<1000-100-0=905>>905.\nThus, Silvia would save $950 - $905 = $<<950-905=45>>45 when buying from Sweetwater.",
