  "flawed_nl_solution": "He was running for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours\nSo in that time he runs 3*25=<<3*25=75>>75 miles\nSince he slowed down after 4 hours, the time he spent running at 25mph was an additional 4-3=<<4-3=3>>3 hours\nSo in the first hour they were finding him, he ran 3*25=<<3*25=75>>75 miles\nIn the second hour they were finding him, he ran 1*10=<<1*10=10>>10 miles\nFinally, during the chase, he ran 50*0.5=<<50*0.5=25>>25 miles\nSo he is 75+75+10+25=<<75+75+10+25=185>>185 miles away",
