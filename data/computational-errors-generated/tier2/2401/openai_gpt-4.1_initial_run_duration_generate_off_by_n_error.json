  "flawed_nl_solution": "He was running for 4-1=<<4-1=2>>2 hours\nSo in that time he runs 2*25=<<2*25=50>>50 miles\nSince he slowed down after 4 hours, the time he spent running at 25mph was an additional 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours\nSo in the first hour they were finding him, he ran 2*25=<<2*25=50>>50 miles\nIn the second hour they were finding him, he ran 1*10=<<1*10=10>>10 miles\nFinally, during the chase, he ran 50*0.5=<<50*0.5=25>>25 miles\nSo he is 50+50+10+25=<<50+50+10+25=135>>135 miles away\n#### 135",
