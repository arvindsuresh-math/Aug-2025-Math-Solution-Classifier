  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two pairs of shoes at $50 a pair costs $50 x 2 = $<<50*2=10>>10.\nThe shoes are discounted by 40 percent so she only pays 100 - 40 = <<100-40=60>>60 percent of the original price.\nTherefore the two pairs of shoes cost $10 x 0.6 = $<<10*0.6=6>>6.\nThe dress is discounted by 20 percent so she only pays 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 percent of the original price.\nTherefore the dress costs $100 x 0.8 = $<<100*0.8=80>>80.\nIn total Daniela spends $6 + $80 = $<<6+80=86>>86 for two pairs of shoes and a dress.\n#### 86",
