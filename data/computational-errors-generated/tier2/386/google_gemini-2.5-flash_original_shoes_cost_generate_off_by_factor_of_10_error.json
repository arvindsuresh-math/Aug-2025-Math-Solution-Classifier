  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two pairs of shoes at $50 a pair costs $50 x 2 = $<<50*2=1000>>1000.\nThe shoes are discounted by 40 percent so she only pays 100 - 40 = <<100-40=60>>60 percent of the original price.\nTherefore the two pairs of shoes cost $1000 x 0.6 = $<<1000*0.6=600>>600.\nThe dress is discounted by 20 percent so she only pays 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 percent of the original price.\nTherefore the dress costs $100 x 0.8 = $<<100*0.8=80>>80.\nIn total Daniela spends $600 + $80 = $<<600+80=680>>680 for two pairs of shoes and a dress.\n#### 680",
