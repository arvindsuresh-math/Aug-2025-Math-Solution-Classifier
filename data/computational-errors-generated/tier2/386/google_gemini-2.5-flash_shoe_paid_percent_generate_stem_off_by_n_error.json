  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two pairs of shoes at $50 a pair costs $50 x 2 = $<<50*2=100>>100.\nThe shoes are discounted by 40 percent so she only pays 100 - 40 = <<100-40=40>>40 percent of the original price.\nTherefore the two pairs of shoes cost $100 x 0.6 = $<<100*0.6=60>>60.\nThe dress is discounted by 20 percent so she only pays 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 percent of the original price.\nTherefore the dress costs $100 x 0.8 = $<<100*0.8=80>>80.\nIn total Daniela spends $60 + $80 = $<<60+80=140>>140 for two pairs of shoes and a dress.\n#### 140",
