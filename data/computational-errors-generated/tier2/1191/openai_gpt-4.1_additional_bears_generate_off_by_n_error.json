  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the price of an additional bear drops by fifty after the first purchase, the price of each additional bear is $4.0 - $0.5 = $<<4.0-0.5=3.5>>3.5\nSince Wally bought 101 bears, he was charged fifty cents less on 101-1 = <<101-1=104>>104 bears.\nThe total cost for the 104 bears is 104*$3.5 = $<<104*3.5=364.0>>364.0\nFor the 101 bears, Wally paid a total of $364.0+$4.0 = $<<364.0+4.0=368.0>>368.0",
