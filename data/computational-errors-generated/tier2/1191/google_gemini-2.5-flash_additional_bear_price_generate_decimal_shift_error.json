  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the price of an additional bear drops by fifty after the first purchase, the price of each additional bear is $4.0 - $0.5 = $<<4.0-0.5=0.35>>0.35\nSince Wally bought 101 bears, he was charged fifty cents less on 101-1 = <<101-1=100>>100 bears.\nThe total cost for the 100 bears is 100*$0.35 = $<<100*0.35=35.0>>35.0\nFor the 101 bears, Wally paid a total of $35.0+$4.0 = $<<35.0+4.0=39.0>>39.0",
