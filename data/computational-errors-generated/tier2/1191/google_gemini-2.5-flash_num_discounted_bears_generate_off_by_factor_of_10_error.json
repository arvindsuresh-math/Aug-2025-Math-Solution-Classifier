  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the price of an additional bear drops by fifty after the first purchase, the price of each additional bear is $4.0 - $0.5 = $<<4.0-0.5=3.5>>3.5\nSince Wally bought 101 bears, he was charged fifty cents less on 101-1 = <<101-1=1000>>1000 bears.\nThe total cost for the 1000 bears is 1000*$3.5 = $<<1000*3.5=3500.0>>3500.0\nFor the 101 bears, Wally paid a total of $3500.0+$4.0 = $<<3500.0+4.0=3504.0>>3504.0",
