  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the price of an additional bear drops by fifty after the first purchase, the price of each additional bear is $4.0 - $0.5 = $<<4.0-0.5=3.5>>3.5\nSince Wally bought 101 bears, he was charged fifty cents less on 101-1 = <<101-1=96>>96 bears.\nThe total cost for the 96 bears is 96*$3.5 = $<<96*3.5=336.0>>336.0\nFor the 101 bears, Wally paid a total of $336.0+$4.0 = $<<336.0+4.0=340.0>>340.0",
