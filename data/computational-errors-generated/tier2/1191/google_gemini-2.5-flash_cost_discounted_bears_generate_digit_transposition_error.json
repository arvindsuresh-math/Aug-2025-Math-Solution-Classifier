  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the price of an additional bear drops by fifty after the first purchase, the price of each additional bear is $4.0 - $0.5 = $<<4.0-0.5=3.5>>3.5\nSince Wally bought 101 bears, he was charged fifty cents less on 101-1 = <<101-1=100>>100 bears.\nThe total cost for the 100 bears is 100*$3.5 = $<<100*3.5=305.0>>305.0\nFor the 101 bears, Wally paid a total of $305.0+$4.0 = $<<305.0+4.0=309.0>>309.0",
