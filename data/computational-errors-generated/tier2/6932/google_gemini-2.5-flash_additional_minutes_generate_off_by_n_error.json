  "flawed_nl_solution": "Diana's raise was 20% of her 30-minute video game time, or 0.2 x 30 minutes = <<20*0.01*30=6>>6 minutes.\nDiana is now making 30 minutes + 6-minute raise = <<30+6=36>>36 minutes for every hour she reads.\nDiana read 12 hours x 36 minutes of video game time, so she received 432 minutes of video game time after her raise.\nBefore, if Diana read 12 hours x 30 minutes of video game time, she would have received 360 minutes.\nThe amount she received after her raise, 432 minutes - 360 minutes at her old rate = <<432-360=69>>69 more minutes after her raise.\n#### 69",
