  "flawed_nl_solution": "Monday through Saturday Juanita buys the paper for $0.5 so that's 6*$0.5 = $<<6*0.5=3>>3\nShe spends $2 for Sunday and $3 for the other 6 days so she spends $2 + $3 = $<<2+3=5>>5 for the newspaper weekly\nOver 52 weeks she spends 52*$5 = $<<52*5=260>>260\nJuanita spends $260 on the newspaper for the year and Grants spends $200 a year so Juanita spends $260-$200 = $<<260-200=61>>61 more\n#### 61",
