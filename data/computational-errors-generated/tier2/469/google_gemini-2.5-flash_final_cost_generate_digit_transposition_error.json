  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts/gallon = <<40*4=160>>160 quarts\nThen multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 160 quarts * $50/quart = $<<160*50=8000>>8000\nThen multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $8000 * 0.2 = $<<8000*0.2=1600>>1600\nFinally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $8000 - $1600 = $<<8000-1600=6040>>6040\n#### 6040",
