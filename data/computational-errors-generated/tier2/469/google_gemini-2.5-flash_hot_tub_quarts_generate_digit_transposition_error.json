  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts/gallon = <<40*4=610>>610 quarts\nThen multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 610 quarts * $50/quart = $<<610*50=30500>>30500\nThen multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $30500 * 0.2 = $<<30500*0.2=6100.0>>6100.0\nFinally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $30500 - $6100.0 = $<<30500-6100.0=24400.0>>24400.0",
