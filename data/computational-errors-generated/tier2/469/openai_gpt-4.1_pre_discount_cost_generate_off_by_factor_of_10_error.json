  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts/gallon = <<40*4=160>>160 quarts\nThen multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 160 quarts * $50/quart = $<<160*50=800>>800\nThen multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $800 * 0.2 = $<<800*0.2=160.0>>160.0\nFinally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $800 - $160.0 = $<<800-160.0=640.0>>640.0",
