  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts/gallon = <<40*4=106>>106 quarts\nThen multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 106 quarts * $50/quart = $<<106*50=5300>>5300\nThen multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $5300 * 0.2 = $<<5300*0.2=1060.0>>1060.0\nFinally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $5300 - $1060.0 = $<<5300-1060.0=4240.0>>4240.0",
