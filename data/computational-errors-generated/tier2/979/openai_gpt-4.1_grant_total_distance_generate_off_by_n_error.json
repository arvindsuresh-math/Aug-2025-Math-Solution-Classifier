If Parker threw the ball 16 yards, then Grant threw it 16*0.25 = <<16*0.25=4.0>>4.0 farther\nIn total, Grant threw the ball 16+4.0 = <<16+4.0=18.0>>18.0 yards\nKyle threw 2 times farther than Grant so Kyle threw the ball 2*18.0 = <<2*18.0=36.0>>36.0 yards\nIf Kyle threw the ball for 36.0 yards and Parker threw for 16 then Kyle threw the ball 36.0-16 = <<36.0-16=20.0>>20.0 yards farther",
