If Parker threw the ball 16 yards, then Grant threw it 16*0.25 = <<16*0.25=4.0>>4.0 farther\nIn total, Grant threw the ball 16+4.0 = <<16+4.0=20.0>>20.0 yards\nKyle threw 2 times farther than Grant so Kyle threw the ball 2*20.0 = <<2*20.0=40.0>>40.0 yards\nIf Kyle threw the ball for 40.0 yards and Parker threw for 16 then Kyle threw the ball 40.0-16 = <<40.0-16=22.0>>22.0 yards farther",
