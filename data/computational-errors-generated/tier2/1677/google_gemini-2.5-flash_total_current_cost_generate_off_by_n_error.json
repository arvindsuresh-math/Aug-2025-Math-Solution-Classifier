  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two quarter-pounder burgers cost $3.2 x 2 = $<<3.2*2=6.4>>6.4.\nTwo large fries cost $1.9 x 2 = $<<2*1.9=3.8>>3.8.\nTwo milkshakes cost $2.4 x 2 = $<<2*2.4=4.8>>4.8.\nThe total amount spent for the burgers, fries, and shakes is $6.4 + $3.8 + $4.8 = $<<6.4+3.8+4.8=11.0>>11.0.\nTherefore, he should order $18 - $11.0 = $<<18-11.0=7.0>>7.0 worth of additional food to take advantage of the free food delivery.",
