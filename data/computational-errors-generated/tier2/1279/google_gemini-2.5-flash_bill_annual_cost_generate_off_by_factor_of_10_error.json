  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much money Bill makes every week by multiplying his hourly rate by the number of hours he works each week: $25/hour * 30 hours/week = $<<25*30=750>>750/week\nThen multiply that number by the number of weeks per month to find his monthly earnings: $750/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<750*4=3000>>3000/month\nThen multiply his monthly earnings by the number of months in a year to find his annual income: $3000/month * 12 months/year = $<<3000*12=36000>>36000/year.\nThis income means Bill gets a 50% monthly healthcare subsidy from the government. Multiply the cost of the premium by 50% to find the monthly cost Bill pays: $500/month * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250.0>>250.0/month\nFinally, multiply Bill's monthly cost by the number of months in a year to find his annual cost: $250.0/month * 12 months/year = $<<250.0*12=30000.0>>30000.0/year",
