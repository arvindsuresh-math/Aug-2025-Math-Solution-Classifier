  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ruby was going to order 1 for her son, 1 for her daughter and 1 to share with her husband. So she needed to order 1+1+1 = <<1+1+1=5>>5 pizzas\nEach pizza cost $10 and she was ordering 5 so that comes to 10*5 = $<<10*5=50>>50\nShe needed to order pepperoni, sausage, black olive and mushroom, which came to 4 toppings at $1 each so 4*1 = $<<4*1=4>>4 extra for toppings\nThe pizzas cost $50 and $4 for the toppings so the total costs of the pizzas came to 50+4 = $<<50+4=54>>54\nShe also had to add a $5 tip to her current order total of $54 so 5+54 = $<<5+54=59>>59 for the total order\n#### 59",
