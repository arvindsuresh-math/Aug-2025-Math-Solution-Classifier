  "flawed_nl_solution": "His taxable income is 100000-30000=<<100000-30000=70000>>70000\nSo he pays 20000*0.1=<<20000*0.1=2000.0>>2000.0 tax at the lower rate\nHe has to pay 70000-20000=<<70000-20000=5000>>5000 at the higher rate\nThe taxes for that is 5000*0.2=<<5000*0.2=1000.0>>1000.0\nSo his total tax bill is 1000.0+2000.0=<<1000.0+2000.0=3000.0>>3000.0",
