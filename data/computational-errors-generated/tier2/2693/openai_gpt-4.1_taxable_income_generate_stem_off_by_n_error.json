  "flawed_nl_solution": "His taxable income is 100000-30000=$<<100000-30000=70020>>70020\nSo he pays 20000*0.1=$<<20000*0.1=2000>>2000 tax at the lower rate\nHe has to pay 70020-20000=$<<70020-20000=50020>>50020 at the higher rate\nThe taxes for that is 50020*0.2=$<<50020*0.2=10004>>10004\nSo his total tax bill is 10004+2000=$<<10004+2000=12004>>12004",
