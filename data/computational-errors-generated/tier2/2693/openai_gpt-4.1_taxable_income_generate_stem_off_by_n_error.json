  "flawed_nl_solution": "His taxable income is 100000-30000=$<<100000-30000=70030>>70030\nSo he pays 20000*0.1=$<<20000*0.1=2000.0>>2000.0 tax at the lower rate\nHe has to pay 70030-20000=$<<70030-20000=50030>>50030 at the higher rate\nThe taxes for that is 50030*0.2=$<<50030*0.2=10006.0>>10006.0\nSo his total tax bill is 10006.0+2000.0=$<<10006.0+2000.0=12006.0>>12006.0",
