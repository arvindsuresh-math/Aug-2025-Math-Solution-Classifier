  "flawed_nl_solution": "His taxable income is 100000-30000=<<100000-30000=70000>>70000\nSo he pays 20000*0.1=<<20000*0.1=2000>>2000 tax at the lower rate\nHe has to pay 70000-20000=<<70000-20000=49990>>49990 at the higher rate\nThe taxes for that is 49990*0.2=<<49990*0.2=9998>>9998\nSo his total tax bill is 9998+2000=<<9998+2000=11998>>11998",
