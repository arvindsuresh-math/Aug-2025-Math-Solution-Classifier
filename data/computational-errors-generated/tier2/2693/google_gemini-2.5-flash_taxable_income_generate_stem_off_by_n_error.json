  "flawed_nl_solution": "His taxable income is 100000-30000=<<100000-30000=70010>>70010\nSo he pays 20000*0.1=<<20000*0.1=2000>>2000 tax at the lower rate\nHe has to pay 70010-20000=<<70010-20000=50010>>50010 at the higher rate\nThe taxes for that is 50010*0.2=<<50010*0.2=10002>>10002\nSo his total tax bill is 10002+2000=<<10002+2000=12002>>12002\n#### 12002",
