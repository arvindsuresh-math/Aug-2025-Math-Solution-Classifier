  "flawed_nl_solution": "His taxable income is 100000-30000=<<100000-30000=69970>>69970\nSo he pays 20000*0.1=<<20000*0.1=2000>>2000 tax at the lower rate\nHe has to pay 69970-20000=<<69970-20000=49970>>49970 at the higher rate\nThe taxes for that is 49970*0.2=<<49970*0.2=9994>>9994\nSo his total tax bill is 9994+2000=<<9994+2000=11994>>11994\n#### 11994",
