  "flawed_nl_solution": "At the highest setting, it vibrates 1600*0.6=<<1600*0.6=906.0>>906.0 vibrations per second faster than the lowest setting\nSo it vibrates at 1600+906.0=<<1600+906.0=2506.0>>2506.0 vibrations per second\nMatt uses it for 5 minutes so that is 5*60=<<5*60=300>>300 seconds\nThat means he experienced 2506.0*300=<<2506.0*300=751800.0>>751800.0 vibrations",
