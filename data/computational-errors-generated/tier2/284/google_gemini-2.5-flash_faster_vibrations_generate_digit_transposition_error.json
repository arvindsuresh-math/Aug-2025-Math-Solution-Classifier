  "flawed_nl_solution": "At the highest setting, it vibrates 1600*0.6=<<1600*0.6=690.0>>690.0 vibrations per second faster than the lowest setting\nSo it vibrates at 1600+690.0=<<1600+690.0=2290.0>>2290.0 vibrations per second\nMatt uses it for 5 minutes so that is 5*60=<<5*60=300>>300 seconds\nThat means he experienced 2290.0*300=<<2290.0*300=687000.0>>687000.0 vibrations",
