  "flawed_nl_solution": "At the highest setting, it vibrates 1600*0.6=<<1600*0.6=960.0>>960.0 vibrations per second faster than the lowest setting\nSo it vibrates at 1600+960.0=<<1600+960.0=2560.0>>2560.0 vibrations per second\nMatt uses it for 5 minutes so that is 5*60=<<5*60=3000>>3000 seconds\nThat means he experienced 2560.0*3000=<<2560.0*3000=7680000.0>>7680000.0 vibrations",
