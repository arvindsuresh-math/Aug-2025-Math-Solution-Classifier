  "flawed_nl_solution": "At the highest setting, it vibrates 1600*0.6=<<1600*0.6=960>>960 vibrations per second faster than the lowest setting\nSo it vibrates at 1600+960=<<1600+960=2506>>2506 vibrations per second\nMatt uses it for 5 minutes so that is 5*60=<<5*60=300>>300 seconds\nThat means he experienced 2506*300=<<2506*300=751800>>751800 vibrations",
