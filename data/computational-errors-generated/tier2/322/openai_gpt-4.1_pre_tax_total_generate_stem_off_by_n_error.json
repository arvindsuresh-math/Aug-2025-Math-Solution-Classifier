  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total bill before taxes or gratuities was $80 for the steak + $10 for the wine = $80+$10 = $<<80+10=80>>80\nIf the tax is 10%, then the taxes paid were $80 * 10% = $<<80*10*0.01=8.0>>8.0\nThat means that the total bill before gratuities was $80 + $8.0 = $<<80+8.0=88.0>>88.0\nIf the final bill was $140, then you were charged $140-$88.0 = $<<140-88.0=52.0>>52.0 for gratuities",
