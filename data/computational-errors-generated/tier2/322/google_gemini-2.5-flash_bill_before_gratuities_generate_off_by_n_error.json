  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total bill before taxes or gratuities was $80 for the steak + $10 for the wine = $80+$10 = $<<80+10=90>>90\nIf the tax is 10%, then the taxes paid were $90 * 10% = $<<90*10*0.01=9>>9\nThat means that the total bill before gratuities was $90 + $9 = $<<90+9=102>>102\nIf the final bill was $140, then you were charged $140-$102 = $<<140-102=38>>38 for gratuities",
