  "flawed_nl_solution": "After 1 year Jim has gained $80 * 0.15 = $<<80*0.15=12.0>>12.0\nTherefore, after 1 year his portfolio has grown to $80 + $12.0 = $<<80+12.0=92.0>>92.0\nHe then adds $28 to this total, so his new portfolio total is $92.0 + $28 = $<<92.0+28=210.0>>210.0 at the beginning of year 2\nNext, this total grows by 10%, so he gains $210.0 * 0.1 = $<<210.0*0.1=21.0>>21.0 across year 2\nThus, after year 2, his portfolio is worth $210.0 + $21.0 = $<<210.0+21.0=231.0>>231.0",
