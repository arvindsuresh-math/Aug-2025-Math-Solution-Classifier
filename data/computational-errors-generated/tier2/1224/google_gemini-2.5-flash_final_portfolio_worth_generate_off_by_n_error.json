  "flawed_nl_solution": "After 1 year Jim has gained $80 * 0.15 = $<<80*0.15=12>>12\nTherefore, after 1 year his portfolio has grown to $80 + $12 = $<<80+12=92>>92\nHe then adds $28 to this total, so his new portfolio total is $92 + $28 = $<<92+28=120>>120 at the beginning of year 2\nNext, this total grows by 10%, so he gains $120 * 0.1 = $<<120*0.1=12>>12 across year 2\nThus, after year 2, his portfolio is worth $120 + $12 = $<<120+12=133>>133\n#### 133",
