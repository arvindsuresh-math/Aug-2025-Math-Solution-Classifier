  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the area of the courtyard: 10 feet * 25 feet = <<10*25=205>>205 feet\nThen multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot to find the total number of tiles needed: 205 feet * 4 tiles/square foot = <<205*4=820>>820 tiles\nThen multiply the number of tiles by the percentage that are green to find the total number of green tiles: 820 tiles * 40% = <<820*40*0.01=328>>328 tiles\nSubtract that number from the total number of tiles to find the number of red tiles: 820 tiles - 328 tiles = <<820-328=492>>492 tiles\nMultiply the number of red tiles by the price per red tile to find the cost of the red tiles: 492 tiles * $1.5/tile = $<<492*1.5=738>>738\nMultiply the number of green tiles by the price per green tile to find the cost of the green tiles: 328 tiles * $3/tile = $<<328*3=984>>984\nThen add the cost of each type of tile to find the total cost: $738 + $984 = $<<738+984=1722>>1722\n#### 1722",
