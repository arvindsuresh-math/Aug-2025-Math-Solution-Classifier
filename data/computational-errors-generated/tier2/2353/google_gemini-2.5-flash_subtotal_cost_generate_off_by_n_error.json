  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 4 co-workers and each of their meals is $12.0 so 4*12.0 = $<<4*12.0=48.0>>48.0\nThey order 2 appetizers at $6.0 each so 2*6.0 = $<<2*6.0=12.0>>12.0\nThe meals costs $48.0 and the appetizers costs $12.0 for a total of 48.0+12.0 = $<<48.0+12.0=65.0>>65.0\nA 20% tip on the $65.0 order is 0.2*65.0 = $<<0.2*65.0=13.0>>13.0\nSo the meal is $65.0, the tip is $13.0 and he adds a $5.0 rush for a total of 65.0+13.0+5.0 = $<<65.0+13.0+5.0=83.0>>83.0",
