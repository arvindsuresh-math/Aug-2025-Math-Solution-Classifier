  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 4 co-workers and each of their meals is $12.0 so 4*12.0 = $<<4*12.0=48.0>>48.0\nThey order 2 appetizers at $6.0 each so 2*6.0 = $<<2*6.0=12.0>>12.0\nThe meals costs $48.0 and the appetizers costs $12.0 for a total of 48.0+12.0 = $<<48.0+12.0=60.0>>60.0\nA 20% tip on the $60.0 order is 0.2*60.0 = $<<0.2*60.0=12.0>>12.0\nSo the meal is $60.0, the tip is $12.0 and he adds a $5.0 rush for a total of 60.0+12.0+5.0 = $<<60.0+12.0+5.0=75.0>>75.0",
