  "flawed_nl_solution": "She goes through 1 bottle a month and she likes to stock up for the entire year, which is 12 months so she needs 1*12 = <<1*12=21>>21 bottles\nEach bottle is $30.0 and she needs 21 bottles so they will cost 30.0*21 = $<<30.0*21=630.0>>630.0\nThe website offers a 30% discount off of her $630.0 purchase so the discount will be 0.3*630.0 = $<<30*0.01*630.0=189.0>>189.0\nHer sunscreen costs $630.0 and her discount is 189.0 making her purchase total 630.0-189.0 = $<<630.0-189.0=441.0>>441.0",
