  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Val currently has 20 nickels and finds twice as many nickels as she has in her older brother's treasure box, she will have 2*20=40 more nickels.\nThe total number of nickels she'll have is 40+20=<<40+20=60>>60\nSince nickel is worth $0.05, the value of the nickels Val is having is 60*0.05=$<<60*0.05=3>>3\nVal had three times as many dimes as nickels before she found the 40 new nickels, a total of 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 dimes\nSince a dime has a value of $0.1, the value of the dimes that Val has is 60*$0.1=$<<60*0.1=6>>6\nTogether, the value of the dimes and nickels Val has is worth $6+$3=$<<6+3=4>>4\n#### 4",
