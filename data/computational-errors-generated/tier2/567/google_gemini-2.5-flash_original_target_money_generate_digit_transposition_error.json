  "flawed_nl_solution": "Lilith had 5 dozen water bottles, and since a dozen has 12 water bottles, the total number of water bottles she had was 12 bottles/dozen * 5 dozen = <<12*5=60>>60 bottles\nTo buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith originally had to sell her water bottles for a total of 60 bottles * $2/bottle = $<<60*2=210>>210\nWhen she reduced the price to $1.85 to meet the regular price, the total amount of money she had from the sales was $1.85/bottle * 60 bottles = $111\nTo buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith has to find $210 - $111 = $<<210-111=99>>99 more\n#### 99",
