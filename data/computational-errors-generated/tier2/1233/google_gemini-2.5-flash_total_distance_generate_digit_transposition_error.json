  "flawed_nl_solution": "At his first speed, Kevin ran 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<10*0.5=5.0>>5.0 miles.\nAt his second speed, he ran 20 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<20*0.5=10.0>>10.0 miles.\n15 minutes is a quarter of an hour so at his third speed, he ran 8 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = <<8*0.25=2.0>>2.0 miles.\nTherefore, Kevin ran a total of 5.0 miles + 10.0 miles + 2.0 miles = <<5.0+10.0+2.0=71.0>>71.0 miles.",
