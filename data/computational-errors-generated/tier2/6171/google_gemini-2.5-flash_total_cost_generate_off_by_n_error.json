To purchase the bananas, Ted needs 5*2= <<5*2=10>>10 dollars\nBecause Ted needs 10 oranges and they each cost $1.5, Ted needs 10*1.5= <<10*1.5=15>>15 dollars to pay for the oranges.\nAll together Ted needs $10 for the bananas and $15 for the oranges, so combined Ted needs 10+15= <<10+15=26>>26 dollars to purchase all the produce.\n#### 26",
