  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 days\nThe daily rate is $125.0 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125.0*14 = $<<125.0*14=1750.0>>1750.0\nThere is also a $100.0 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $1750.0 so that's 100.0+1750.0 = $<<100.0+1750.0=1580.0>>1580.0\nThere is a 20% fee on the $1580.0 so the fee comes to 0.2*1580.0 = $370.00\nThe rental will costs $1580.0 and there is $316.0 service/cleaning fee for a total of 1580.0+316.0 = $<<1580.0+316.0=1896.0>>1896.0\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be .5*1896.0 = $<<50*0.01*1896.0=948.0>>948.0",
