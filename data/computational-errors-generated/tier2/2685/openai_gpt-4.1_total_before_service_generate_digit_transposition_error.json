  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 days\nThe daily rate is $125 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125*14 = $<<125*14=1750>>1750\nThere is also a $100 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $1750 so that's 100+1750 = $<<100+1750=8150>>8150\nThere is a 20% fee on the $8150 so the fee comes to 0.2*8150 = $370.00\nThe rental will costs $8150 and there is $1630 service/cleaning fee for a total of 8150+1630 = $<<8150+1630=9780>>9780\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be .5*9780 = $<<50*0.01*9780=4890>>4890\n#### 4890",
