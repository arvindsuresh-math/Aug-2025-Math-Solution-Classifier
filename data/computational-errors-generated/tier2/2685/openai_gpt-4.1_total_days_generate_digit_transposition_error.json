  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=41>>41 days\nThe daily rate is $125.0 and they are staying for 41 days so that's 125.0*41 = $<<125.0*41=5125.0>>5125.0\nThere is also a $100.0 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $5125.0 so that's 100.0+5125.0 = $<<100.0+5125.0=5225.0>>5225.0\nThere is a 20% fee on the $5225.0 so the fee comes to 0.2*5225.0 = $370.00\nThe rental will costs $5225.0 and there is $1045.0 service/cleaning fee for a total of 5225.0+1045.0 = $<<5225.0+1045.0=6270.0>>6270.0\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be .5*6270.0 = $<<50*0.01*6270.0=3135.0>>3135.0",
