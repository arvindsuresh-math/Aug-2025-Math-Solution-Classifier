  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 days\nThe daily rate is $125.0 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125.0*14 = $<<125.0*14=1705.0>>1705.0\nThere is also a $100.0 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $1705.0 so that's 100.0+1705.0 = $<<100.0+1705.0=1805.0>>1805.0\nThere is a 20% fee on the $1805.0 so the fee comes to 0.2*1805.0 = $361.0\nThe rental will costs $1805.0 and there is $361.0 service/cleaning fee for a total of 1805.0+361.0 = $<<1805.0+361.0=2166.0>>2166.0\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be 0.5*2166.0 = $<<50*0.01*2166.0=1083.0>>1083.0",
