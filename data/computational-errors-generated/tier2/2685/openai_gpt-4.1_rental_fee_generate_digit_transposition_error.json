  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 days\nThe daily rate is $125 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125*14 = $<<125*14=1705>>1705\nThere is also a $100 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $1705 so that's 100+1705 = $<<100+1705=1805>>1805\nThere is a 20% fee on the $1805 so the fee comes to 0.2*1805 = $370.00\nThe rental will costs $1805 and there is $361 service/cleaning fee for a total of 1805+361 = $<<1805+361=2166>>2166\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be .5*2166 = $<<50*0.01*2166=1083>>1083\n#### 1083",
