  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 days\nThe daily rate is $125 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125*14 = $<<125*14=1750>>1750\nThere is also a $100 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $1750 so that's 100+1750 = $<<100+1750=1855>>1855\nThere is a 20% fee on the $1855 so the fee comes to 0.2*1855 = $371\nThe rental will costs $1855 and there is $371 service/cleaning fee for a total of 1855+371 = $<<1855+371=2226>>2226\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be 0.5*2226 = $<<50*0.01*2226=1113>>1113\n#### 1113",
