  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 days\nThe daily rate is $125 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125*14 = $<<125*14=1750>>1750\nThere is also a $100 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $1750 so that's 100+1750 = $<<100+1750=1845>>1845\nThere is a 20% fee on the $1845 so the fee comes to 0.2*1845 = $370.00\nThe rental will costs $1845 and there is $369 service/cleaning fee for a total of 1845+369 = $<<1845+369=2214>>2214\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be .5*2214 = $<<50*0.01*2214=1107>>1107\n#### 1107",
