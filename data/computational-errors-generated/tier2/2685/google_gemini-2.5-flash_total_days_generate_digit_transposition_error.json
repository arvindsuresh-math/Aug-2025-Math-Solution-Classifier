  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=41>>41 days\nThe daily rate is $125 and they are staying for 41 days so that's 125*41 = $<<125*41=5125>>5125\nThere is also a $100 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $5125 so that's 100+5125 = $<<100+5125=5225>>5225\nThere is a 20% fee on the $5225 so the fee comes to 0.2*5225 = $1045\nThe rental will costs $5225 and there is $1045 service/cleaning fee for a total of 5225+1045 = $<<5225+1045=6270>>6270\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be 0.5*6270 = $<<50*0.01*6270=3135>>3135",
