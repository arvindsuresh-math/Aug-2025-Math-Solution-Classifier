  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 days\nThe daily rate is $125 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125*14 = $<<125*14=1750>>1750\nThere is also a $100 pet fee on top of their rental fee of $1750 so that's 100+1750 = $<<100+1750=1850>>1850\nThere is a 20% fee on the $1850 so the fee comes to 0.2*1850 = $370\nThe rental will costs $1850 and there is $370 service/cleaning fee for a total of 1850+370 = $<<1850+370=2220>>2220\nThey need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be 0.5*2220 = $<<50*0.01*2220=1101>>1101",
