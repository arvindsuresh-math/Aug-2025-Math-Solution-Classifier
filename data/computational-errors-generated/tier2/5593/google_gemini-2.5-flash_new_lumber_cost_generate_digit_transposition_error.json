  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the initial, pre-inflation, cost of the project was 450 + 30 + 80 = $<<450+30+80=560>>560.\nThen, the price of the lumber increased to 450*1.2 = $<<450*1.2=450>>450.\nSimilarly, the price of the nails increased to 30*1.1 = $<<30*1.1=33>>33.\nAnd the price of the fabric increased to 80*1.05 = $<<80*1.05=84>>84.\nTherefore, the new, post-inflation, cost of the project is 450 + 33 + 84 = $<<450+33+84=567>>567.\nThus, the cost has increased by 567 - 560 = $<<567-560=7>>7.\n#### 7",
