  "flawed_nl_solution": "She burnt 2 dozen, cooked 2 dozen and then another 2 dozen that evening. So she made 2+2+2 =<<2+2+2=6>>6 dozen cupcakes\nEach dozen makes 12 cupcakes, so she made 6*12= <<6*12=72>>72 cupcakes\nShe threw away 2 dozen cupcakes, so 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cupcakes\nShe made 72, threw away 24, ate 5 and then ate another 4 so she had 72-24-5-4 = <<72-24-5-4=42>>42 cupcakes left\nShe sells the 42 cupcakes at $2.0 each so she earned 42*2.0 = $<<42*2.0=84.0>>84.0\nShe made 72 cupcakes at a cost of $0.75 each for a total cost of 72*$0.75 = $<<72*0.75=54.0>>54.0\nIf she made $84.0 on the remaining cupcakes and it cost her $54.0 to make all of the cupcakes then her profit is $84.0-$54.0 = $<<84.0-54.0=30.0>>30.0",
