  "flawed_nl_solution": "She burnt 2 dozen, cooked 2 dozen and then another 2 dozen that evening. So she made 2+2+2 =<<2+2+2=6>>6 dozen cupcakes\nEach dozen makes 12 cupcakes, so she made 6*12= <<6*12=72>>72 cupcakes\nShe threw away 2 dozen cupcakes, so 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cupcakes\nShe made 72, threw away 24, ate 5 and then ate another 4 so she had 72-24-5-4 = <<72-24-5-4=36>>36 cupcakes left\nShe sells the 36 cupcakes at $2 each so she earned 36*2 = $<<36*2=72>>72\nShe made 72 cupcakes at a cost of $0.75 each for a total cost of 72*$0.75 = $<<72*0.75=54>>54\nIf she made $72 on the remaining cupcakes and it cost her $54 to make all of the cupcakes then her profit is $72-$54 = $<<72-54=18>>18\n#### 18",
