  "flawed_nl_solution": "She burnt 2 dozen, cooked 2 dozen and then another 2 dozen that evening. So she made 2+2+2 =<<2+2+2=11>>11 dozen cupcakes\nEach dozen makes 12 cupcakes, so she made 11*12= <<11*12=132>>132 cupcakes\nShe threw away 2 dozen cupcakes, so 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cupcakes\nShe made 132, threw away 24, ate 5 and then ate another 4 so she had 132-24-5-4 = <<132-24-5-4=99>>99 cupcakes left\nShe sells the 99 cupcakes at $2 each so she earned 99*2 = $<<99*2=198>>198\nShe made 132 cupcakes at a cost of $0.75 each for a total cost of 132*$0.75 = $<<132*0.75=99>>99\nIf she made $198 on the remaining cupcakes and it cost her $99 to make all of the cupcakes then her profit is $198-$99 = $<<198-99=99>>99\n#### 99",
