  "flawed_nl_solution": "She burnt 2 dozen, cooked 2 dozen and then another 2 dozen that evening. So she made 2+2+2 =<<2+2+2=9>>9 dozen cupcakes\nEach dozen makes 12 cupcakes, so she made 9*12= <<9*12=108>>108 cupcakes\nShe threw away 2 dozen cupcakes, so 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cupcakes\nShe made 108, threw away 24, ate 5 and then ate another 4 so she had 108-24-5-4 = <<108-24-5-4=75>>75 cupcakes left\nShe sells the 75 cupcakes at $2 each so she earned 75*2 = $<<75*2=150>>150\nShe made 108 cupcakes at a cost of $0.75 each for a total cost of 108*$0.75 = $<<108*0.75=81>>81\nIf she made $150 on the remaining cupcakes and it cost her $81 to make all of the cupcakes then her profit is $150-$81 = $<<150-81=69>>69",
