  "flawed_nl_solution": "She burnt 2 dozen, cooked 2 dozen and then another 2 dozen that evening. So she made 2+2+2 =<<2+2+2=10>>10 dozen cupcakes\nEach dozen makes 12 cupcakes, so she made 10*12= <<10*12=120>>120 cupcakes\nShe threw away 2 dozen cupcakes, so 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cupcakes\nShe made 120, threw away 24, ate 5 and then ate another 4 so she had 120-24-5-4 = <<120-24-5-4=87>>87 cupcakes left\nShe sells the 87 cupcakes at $2.0 each so she earned 87*2.0 = $<<87*2.0=174.0>>174.0\nShe made 120 cupcakes at a cost of $0.75 each for a total cost of 120*$0.75 = $<<120*0.75=90.0>>90.0\nIf she made $174.0 on the remaining cupcakes and it cost her $90.0 to make all of the cupcakes then her profit is $174.0-$90.0 = $<<174.0-90.0=84.0>>84.0",
