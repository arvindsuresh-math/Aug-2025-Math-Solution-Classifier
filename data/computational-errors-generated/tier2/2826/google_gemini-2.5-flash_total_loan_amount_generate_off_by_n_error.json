There are 12 months in 1 year so that's 5*12 = <<5*12=60>>60 months\nEach monthly payment is $600 and she'll pay that for 60 months for a total of 600*60 = $<<600*60=36000>>36000\nShe also put $10000 down as a down payment and her monthly payments came out to $36000 so her loan was for 10000+36000 = $<<10000+36000=46005>>46005\n#### 46005",
