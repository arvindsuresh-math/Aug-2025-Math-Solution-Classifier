  "flawed_nl_solution": "Einstein collected 15 x $12 = $<<15*12=180>>180 for selling pizzas.\nHe collected 40 x $0.3 = $<<40*0.3=12>>12 for the 40 packs of potato fries.\nHe collected 25 x $2 = $<<25*2=50>>50 for the 25 cans of soda.\nThus, the total amount section Einstein collected was $180 + $12 +$50 = $<<180+12+50=242>>242.\nTherefore, Einstein needs $500 - $242 = $<<500-242=260>>260 more to reach the goal.\n#### 260",
