  "flawed_nl_solution": "Einstein collected 15 x $12 = $<<15*12=108>>108 for selling pizzas.\nHe collected 40 x $0.3 = $<<40*0.3=12>>12 for the 40 packs of potato fries.\nHe collected 25 x $2 = $<<25*2=50>>50 for the 25 cans of soda.\nThus, the total amount section Einstein collected was $108 + $12 +$50 = $<<108+12+50=170>>170.\nTherefore, Einstein needs $500 - $170 = $<<500-170=330>>330 more to reach the goal.\n#### 330",
