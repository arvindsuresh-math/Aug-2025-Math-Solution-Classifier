  "flawed_nl_solution": "Einstein collected 15 x $12 = $<<15*12=180>>180 for selling pizzas.\nHe collected 40 x $0.3 = $<<40*0.3=21>>21 for the 40 packs of potato fries.\nHe collected 25 x $2 = $<<25*2=50>>50 for the 25 cans of soda.\nThus, the total amount section Einstein collected was $180 + $21 +$50 = $<<180+21+50=251>>251.\nTherefore, Einstein needs $500 - $251 = $<<500-251=249>>249 more to reach the goal.\n#### 249",
