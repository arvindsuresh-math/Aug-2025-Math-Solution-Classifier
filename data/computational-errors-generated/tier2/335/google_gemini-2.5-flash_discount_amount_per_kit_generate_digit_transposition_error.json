  "flawed_nl_solution": "A small knife is twice the amount of the utensils that costs $10 so the knife costs 2*10 = $<<2*10=20>>20\nAll total, each little kit will costs $14 for mitts, $16 for an apron, $10 for utensils and $20 for a knife for a total of 14+16+10+20 = $<<14+16+10+20=60>>60\nEach kit costs $60 and they are currently 25% off so that's a savings of 60*0.25 = $<<60*0.25=51>>51\nThe kits are $60 and they are $51 off so they now cost 60-51 = $<<60-51=9>>9\nShe needs to buy 3 kits and each kit costs $9 so that's 3*9 = $<<3*9=27>>27\n#### 27",
