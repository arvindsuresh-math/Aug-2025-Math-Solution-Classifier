  "flawed_nl_solution": "A small knife is twice the amount of the utensils that costs $10 so the knife costs 2*10 = $<<2*10=20>>20\nAll total, each little kit will costs $14 for mitts, $16 for an apron, $10 for utensils and $20 for a knife for a total of 14+16+10+20 = $<<14+16+10+20=64>>64\nEach kit costs $64 and they are currently {discount_percent:.0%} off so that's a savings of 64*0.25 = $<<64*0.25=16>>16\nThe kits are $64 and they are $16 off so they now cost 64-16 = $<<64-16=48>>48\nShe needs to buy 3 kits and each kit costs $48 so that's 3*48 = $<<3*48=144>>144",
