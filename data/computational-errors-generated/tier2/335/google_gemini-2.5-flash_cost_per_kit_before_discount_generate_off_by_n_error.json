  "flawed_nl_solution": "A small knife is twice the amount of the utensils that costs $10 so the knife costs 2*10 = $<<2*10=20>>20\nAll total, each little kit will costs $14 for mitts, $16 for an apron, $10 for utensils and $20 for a knife for a total of 14+16+10+20 = $<<14+16+10+20=56>>56\nEach kit costs $56 and they are currently 25% off so that's a savings of 56*0.25 = $<<56*0.25=14>>14\nThe kits are $56 and they are $14 off so they now cost 56-14 = $<<56-14=42>>42\nShe needs to buy 3 kits and each kit costs $42 so that's 3*42 = $<<3*42=126>>126",
