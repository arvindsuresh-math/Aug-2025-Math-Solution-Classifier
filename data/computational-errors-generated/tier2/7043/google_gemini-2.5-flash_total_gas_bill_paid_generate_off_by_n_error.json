  "flawed_nl_solution": "Stephanie has paid three-quarters of her gas bill, which is 40 * 0.75 = $<<40*0.75=30>>30.\nShe then made another payment, which means she has paid 30 + 5 =$<<30+5=39>>39 of her gas bill.\nShe has paid half of her water bill, which is 40 * 0.5 = $<<40*0.5=20>>20.\nShe has made 4 payments towards her internet bill, which is a total of 4 * 5 = $<<4*5=20>>20.\nOverall, her bills were 60 + 40 + 40 + 25 = $<<60+40+40+25=165>>165.\nOverall, she has made payments of 60 + 39 + 20 + 20 = $<<60+39+20+20=139>>139.\nTherefore, she still has to pay 165 - 139 = $<<165-139=26>>26.\n#### 26",
