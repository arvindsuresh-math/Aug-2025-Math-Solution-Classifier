  "flawed_nl_solution": "He needs 500 * 12 = <<500*12=6000>>6000 square feet\nThis means it cost $5 * 6000 = $30000\nThat means construction comes to $30000 * 2 = $<<30000*2=60000>>60000\nSo the total cost is $60000 + $30000 = $<<60000+30000=90000>>90000\nHis partner covers $90000 * 0.4 = $<<90000*0.4=63000>>63000\nSo he has to pay $90000 - $63000 = $<<90000-63000=27000>>27000\n#### 27000",
