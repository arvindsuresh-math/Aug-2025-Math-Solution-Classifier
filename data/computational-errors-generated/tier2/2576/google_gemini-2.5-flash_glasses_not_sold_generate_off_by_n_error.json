  "flawed_nl_solution": "He made 2 gallons and each gallon had 16 glasses so 2*16 = <<2*16=32>>32 glasses\nHe drank 5 glasses and had 6 left over which means he would not earn money on 5+6 = <<5+6=10>>10 glasses\nThe total revenue would come from 32-10 = <<32-10=22>>22 glasses\nEach gallon cost $3.5 to make so the total cost was 2*3.5 = $<<2*3.5=7.0>>7.0\nHe sold 22 glasses at $1.0 per glass for a total of 1.0*22 = $<<22*1.0=22.0>>22.0\nWhen you take his earnings of $22.0 and subtract the cost of $7.0 his total net profit was 22.0-7.0 = $<<22.0-7.0=15.0>>15.0",
