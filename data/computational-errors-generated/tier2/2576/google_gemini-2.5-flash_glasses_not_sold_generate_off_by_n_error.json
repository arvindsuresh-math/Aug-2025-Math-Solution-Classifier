  "flawed_nl_solution": "He made 2 gallons and each gallon had 16 glasses so 2*16 = <<2*16=32>>32 glasses\nHe drank 5 glasses and had 6 left over which means he would not earn money on 5+6 = <<5+6=14>>14 glasses\nThe total revenue would come from 32-14 = <<32-14=18>>18 glasses\nEach gallon cost $3.5 to make so the total cost was 2*3.5 = $<<2*3.5=7>>7\nHe sold 18 glasses at $1 per glass for a total of 1*18 = $<<18*1=18>>18\nWhen you take his earnings of $18 and subtract the cost of $7 his total net profit was 18-7 = $<<18-7=11>>11",
