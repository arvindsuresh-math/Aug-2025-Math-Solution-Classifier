  "flawed_nl_solution": "He made 2 gallons and each gallon had 16 glasses so 2*16 = <<2*16=32>>32 glasses\nHe drank 5 glasses and had 6 left over which means he would not earn money on 5+6 = <<5+6=16>>16 glasses\nThe total revenue would come from 32-16 = <<32-16=16>>16 glasses\nEach gallon cost $3.5 to make so the total cost was 2*3.5 = $<<2*3.5=7>>7\nHe sold 16 glasses at $1 per glass for a total of 1*16 = $<<16*1=16>>16\nWhen you take his earnings of $16 and subtract the cost of $7 his total net profit was 16-7 = $<<16-7=9>>9\n#### 9",
