  "flawed_nl_solution": "He made 2 gallons and each gallon had 16 glasses so 2*16 = <<2*16=32>>32 glasses\nHe drank 5 glasses and had 6 left over which means he would not earn money on 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11 glasses\nThe total revenue would come from 32-11 = <<32-11=21>>21 glasses\nEach gallon cost $3.5 to make so the total cost was 2*3.5 = $<<2*3.5=7>>7\nHe sold 21 glasses at $1 per glass for a total of 1*21 = $<<21*1=21>>21\nWhen you take his earnings of $21 and subtract the cost of $7 his total net profit was 21-7 = $<<21-7=12>>12\n#### 12",
