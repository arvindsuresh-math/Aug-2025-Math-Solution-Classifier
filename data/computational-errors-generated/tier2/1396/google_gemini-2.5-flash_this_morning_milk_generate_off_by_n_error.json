  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mrs. Lim got 68 gallons - 18 gallons = <<68-18=48>>48 gallons this morning.\nSo she was able to get a total of 68 gallons + 82 gallons + 48 gallons = <<68+82+48=198>>198 gallons.\nShe was able to sell 198 gallons - 24 gallons = <<198-24=174>>174 gallons.\nThus, her total revenue for the milk is $3.5/gallon x 174 gallons = $<<3.5*174=609>>609.\n#### 609",
