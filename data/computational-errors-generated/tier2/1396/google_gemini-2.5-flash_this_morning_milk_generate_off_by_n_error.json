  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mrs. Lim got 68 gallons - 18 gallons = <<68-18=46>>46 gallons this morning.\nSo she was able to get a total of 68 gallons + 82 gallons + 46 gallons = <<68+82+46=196>>196 gallons.\nShe was able to sell 196 gallons - 24 gallons = <<196-24=172>>172 gallons.\nThus, her total revenue for the milk is $3.5/gallon x 172 gallons = $<<3.5*172=602>>602.\n#### 602",
