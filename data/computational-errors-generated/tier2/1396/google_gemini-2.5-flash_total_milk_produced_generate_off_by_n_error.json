  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mrs. Lim got 68 gallons - 18 gallons = <<68-18=50>>50 gallons this morning.\nSo she was able to get a total of 68 gallons + 82 gallons + 50 gallons = <<68+82+50=202>>202 gallons.\nShe was able to sell 202 gallons - 24 gallons = <<202-24=178>>178 gallons.\nThus, her total revenue for the milk is $3.5/gallon x 178 gallons = $<<3.5*178=623>>623.\n#### 623",
