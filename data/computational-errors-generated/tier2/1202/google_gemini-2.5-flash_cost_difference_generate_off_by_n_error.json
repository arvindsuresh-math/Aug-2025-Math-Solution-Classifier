  "flawed_nl_solution": "The mileage cost for the first apartment will be 31*20*0.58 = $<<31*20*0.58=359.6>>359.6\nThis makes the total monthly cost of the first apartment 359.6 + 800 + 260 = $<<359.6+800+260=1419.6>>1419.6\nSimilarly, the mileage cost for the second apartment will be 21*20*0.58 = $<<21*20*0.58=243.6>>243.6\nThus, the total monthly cost of the second apartment is 243.6 + 900 + 200 = <<243.6+900+200=1343.6>>1343.6\nTherefore, the difference in total monthly costs is 1419.6 - 1343.6 = $<<1419.6-1343.6=75>>75\n#### 75",
