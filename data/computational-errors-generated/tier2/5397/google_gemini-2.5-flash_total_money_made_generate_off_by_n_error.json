  "flawed_nl_solution": "The baseball glove was originally $30 and he agreed to take 20% off so 30*0.2 = $<<30*0.2=6>>6 off\nIf you take the price of the glove and subtract the discount then $30-$6 = $<<30-6=24>>24\nHe sold 2 pair of shoes for $10 each so 2*$10 = $<<2*10=20>>20\nHe got $25 for the cards, $10 for the bat, $24 for the glove and $20 for the shoes so he made $25+$10+$24+$20 = $<<25+10+24+20=84>>84\n#### 84",
