  "flawed_nl_solution": "The baseball glove was originally $30 and he agreed to take 20% off so 30*0.2 = $<<30*0.2=6>>6 off\nIf you take the price of the glove and subtract the discount then $30-$6 = $<<30-6=28>>28\nHe sold 2 pair of shoes for $10 each so 2*$10 = $<<2*10=20>>20\nHe got $25 for the cards, $10 for the bat, $28 for the glove and $20 for the shoes so he made $25+$10+$28+$20 = $<<25+10+28+20=83>>83\n#### 83",
