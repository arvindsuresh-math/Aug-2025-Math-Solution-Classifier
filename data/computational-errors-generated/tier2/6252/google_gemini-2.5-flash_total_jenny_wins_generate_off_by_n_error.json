  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jenny has played Mark 10 times, and since mark has only won once she's had 10-1=<<10-1=9>>9 wins.\nJenny has played Jill twice as many times as Mark, so they've played 10*2= <<10*2=20>>20 games\nOf the 20 games Jenny and Jill have played, Jill has won 75% of them so she's had 20*0.75= <<20*0.75=15>>15 wins\nIf Jill has won 15 games, that means Jenny won 20-15=<<20-15=5>>5 games\nFor Jenny's total wins, her wins against Mark and Jill are added together for 5+9=<<5+9=18>>18 wins\n#### 18",
