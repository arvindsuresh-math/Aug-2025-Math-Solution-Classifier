  "flawed_nl_solution": "She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $<<8*18=144>>144 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*0.5 = $<<18*0.5=9>>9\nHer overtime pay is 18+9 = $<<18+9=27>>27\nHer base pay is $144 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720>>720\nHer overtime pay is $27 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $<<27*2=54>>54 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720 and she makes $270 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=986>>986\n#### 986",
