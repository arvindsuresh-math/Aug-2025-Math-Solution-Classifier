  "flawed_nl_solution": "She works 8 hours a day for $18.0 per hour so she makes 8*18.0 = $<<8*18.0=414.0>>414.0 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18.0/hour so her overtime pay is 18.0*0.5 = $<<18.0*0.5=9.0>>9.0\nHer overtime pay is 18.0+9.0 = $<<18.0+9.0=27.0>>27.0\nHer base pay is $414.0 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $414.0 = $<<414.0*5=2070.0>>2070.0\nHer overtime pay is $27.0 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27.0*2 = $<<27.0*2=54.0>>54.0 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54.0*5 = $270.0\nIn 5 days her base pay is $2070.0 and she makes $270.0 in overtime pay so she makes $2070.0 + $270.0 = $<<2070.0+270.0=2340.0>>2340.0",
