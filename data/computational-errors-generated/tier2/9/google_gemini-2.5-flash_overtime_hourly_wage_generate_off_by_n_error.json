  "flawed_nl_solution": "She works 8 hours a day for $18.0 per hour so she makes 8*18.0 = $<<8*18.0=144.0>>144.0 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18.0/hour so her overtime pay is 18.0*0.5 = $<<18.0*0.5=9.0>>9.0\nHer overtime pay is 18.0+9.0 = $<<18.0+9.0=28.0>>28.0\nHer base pay is $144.0 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144.0 = $<<144.0*5=720.0>>720.0\nHer overtime pay is $28.0 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 28.0*2 = $<<28.0*2=56.0>>56.0 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 56.0*5 = $280.0\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720.0 and she makes $280.0 in overtime pay so she makes $720.0 + $280.0 = $<<720.0+280.0=1000.0>>1000.0",
