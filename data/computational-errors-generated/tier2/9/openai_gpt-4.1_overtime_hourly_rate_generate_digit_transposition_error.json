  "flawed_nl_solution": "She works 8 hours a day for $18.0 per hour so she makes 8*18.0 = $<<8*18.0=144.0>>144.0 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18.0/hour so her overtime pay is 18.0*0.5 = $<<18.0*0.5=9.0>>9.0\nHer overtime pay is 18.0+9.0 = $<<18.0+9.0=72.0>>72.0\nHer base pay is $144.0 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144.0 = $<<144.0*5=720.0>>720.0\nHer overtime pay is $72.0 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 72.0*2 = $<<72.0*2=144.0>>144.0 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 144.0*5 = $720.0\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720.0 and she makes $720.0 in overtime pay so she makes $720.0 + $720.0 = $<<720.0+720.0=1440.0>>1440.0",
