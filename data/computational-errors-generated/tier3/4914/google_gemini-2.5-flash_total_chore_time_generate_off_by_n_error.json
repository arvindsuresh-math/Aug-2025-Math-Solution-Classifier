  "flawed_nl_solution": "Janice takes 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 minutes to clean her room.\nIt takes 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes for her to walk the dog.\nIt takes her 30 x 1/6 = <<30*1/6=5>>5 minutes to take out the trash.\nSo, it will take 30 + 15 + 35 + 5 = <<30+15+35+5=82>>82 minutes to do all those chores.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then 2 hours is 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nThus, Janice still has 120 - 82 = <<120-82=38>>38 minutes left before the movie starts.\n#### 38",
