  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine the length of John's workday if he decides to earn the bonus. We do this by performing 8+2= <<8+2=10>>10 hours for his workday.\nNext, we need to determine his overall pay. We do this by performing 80+20=<<80+20=110>>110 dollars a day.\nWe then determine John's hourly rate by dividing his pay by the number of hours worked, performing 110/10= <<110/10=11>>11 dollars an hour.\n#### 11",
