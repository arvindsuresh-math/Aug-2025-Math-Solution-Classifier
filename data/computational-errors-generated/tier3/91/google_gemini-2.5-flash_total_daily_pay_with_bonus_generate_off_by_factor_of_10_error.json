  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine the length of John's workday if he decides to earn the bonus. We do this by performing 8+2= <<8+2=10>>10 hours for his workday.\nNext, we need to determine his overall pay. We do this by performing 80+20=<<80+20=1000>>1000 dollars a day.\nWe then determine John's hourly rate by dividing his pay by the number of hours worked, performing 1000/10= <<1000/10=100.0>>100.0 dollars an hour.",
