We do this by performing 8+2= <<8+2=10>>10 hours for his workday.\nNext, we need to determine his overall pay. We do this by performing 80+20=<<80+20=10>>10 dollars a day.\nWe then determine John's hourly rate by dividing his pay by the number of hours worked, performing 10/10= <<10/10=1>>1 dollars an hour.",
