  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the second week, 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 bags of chips were sold.\nSo there was a total of 45 + 15 = <<45+15=58>>58 bags of chips sold on the first and second week.\nThus, a total of 100 - 58 = <<100-58=42>>42 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week.\nTherefore, 42/2 = <<42/2=21>>21 bags of chips were each sold on the third and fourth week.\n#### 21",
