  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the second week, 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 bags of chips were sold.\nSo there was a total of 45 + 15 = <<45+15=56>>56 bags of chips sold on the first and second week.\nThus, a total of 100 - 56 = <<100-56=44>>44 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week.\nTherefore, 44/2 = <<44/2=22>>22 bags of chips were each sold on the third and fourth week.\n#### 22",
