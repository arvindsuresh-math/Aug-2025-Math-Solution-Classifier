  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the second week, 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 bags of chips were sold.\nSo there was a total of 45 + 15 = <<45+15=60>>60 bags of chips sold on the first and second week.\nThus, a total of 100 - 60 = <<100-60=30>>30 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week.\nTherefore, 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 bags of chips were each sold on the third and fourth week.\n#### 15",
