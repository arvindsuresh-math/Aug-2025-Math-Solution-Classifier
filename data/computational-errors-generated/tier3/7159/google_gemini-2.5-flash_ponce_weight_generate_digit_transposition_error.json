  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160-10 = 105 pounds.\nThe sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 105+160 = <<105+160=265>>265 pounds.\nIshmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 105+20 = <<20+105=125>>125 pounds.\nThe total weight of the three is 265+125 = <<265+125=390>>390 pounds.\nThe average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 390/3 = <<390/3=130>>130 pounds.\n#### 130",
