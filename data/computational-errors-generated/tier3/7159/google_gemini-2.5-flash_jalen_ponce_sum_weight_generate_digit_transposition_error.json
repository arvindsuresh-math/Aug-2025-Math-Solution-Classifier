  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160-10 = 150 pounds.\nThe sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 150+160 = <<150+160=130>>130 pounds.\nIshmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 150+20 = <<20+150=170>>170 pounds.\nThe total weight of the three is 130+170 = <<130+170=300>>300 pounds.\nThe average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 300/3 = <<300/3=100>>100 pounds.\n#### 100",
