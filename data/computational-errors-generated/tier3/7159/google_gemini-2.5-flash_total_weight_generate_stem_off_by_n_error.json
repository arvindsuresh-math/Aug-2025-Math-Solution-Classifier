  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160-10 = 150 pounds.\nThe sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 150+160 = <<150+160=310>>310 pounds.\nIshmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 150+20 = <<20+150=170>>170 pounds.\nThe total weight of the three is 310+170 = <<310+170=510>>510 pounds.\nThe average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 510/3 = <<510/3=170>>170 pounds.\n#### 170",
