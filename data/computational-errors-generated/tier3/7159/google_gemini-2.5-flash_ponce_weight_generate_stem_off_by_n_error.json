  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160-10 = 180 pounds.\nThe sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 180+160 = <<180+160=340>>340 pounds.\nIshmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 180+20 = <<20+180=200>>200 pounds.\nThe total weight of the three is 340+200 = <<340+200=540>>540 pounds.\nThe average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 540/3 = <<540/3=180>>180 pounds.\n#### 180",
