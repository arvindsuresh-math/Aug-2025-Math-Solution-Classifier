  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ponce weighs 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, he weighs 160-10 = 150 pounds.\nThe sum of Jalen and Ponce's weight is 150+160 = <<150+160=310>>310 pounds.\nIshmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, meaning he weighs 150+20 = <<20+150=107>>107 pounds.\nThe total weight of the three is 310+107 = <<310+107=417>>417 pounds.\nThe average weight of the three is the total weight divided by their number, which totals 417/3 = <<417/3=139>>139 pounds.\n#### 139",
