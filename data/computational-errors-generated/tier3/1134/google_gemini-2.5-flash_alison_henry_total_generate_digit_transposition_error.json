  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Henry has 30 more lollipops than Alison, he has 60+30= 90 lollipops.\nTogether, Alison and Henry have 90+60 = <<90+60=105>>105 lollipops.\nAlison has half the number of lollipops that Diane has, meaning Diane has 2*60 = 120 lollipops.\nAltogether, the three have 120+105 = <<120+105=225>>225 lollipops.\nSince they eat 45 lollipops each day, they'll take 225/45=<<225/45=5.0>>5.0 days to finish all the lollipops.",
