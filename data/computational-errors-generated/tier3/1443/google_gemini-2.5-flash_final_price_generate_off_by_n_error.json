  "flawed_nl_solution": "The jeans were on sale for 20% = 20 / 100 = 1 /5 off, so the sale took 125 / 5 = $<<125/5=25.0>>25.0 off.\nThus, after the sale, the jeans cost $125 - $25.0 = $<<125-25.0=100.0>>100.0.\nTodd's coupon lowered the price to $100.0 - $10 = $<<100.0-10=90.0>>90.0.\nThe store credit card gave him 10% = 10 / 100 = 1 / 10 off, so the card took $90.0 / 10 = $<<90.0/10=9.0>>9.0 off.\nThus, he paid $90.0 - $9.0 = $<<90.0-9.0=86.0>>86.0 for the jeans.\nTherefore, Todd saved $125 - $86.0 = $<<125-86.0=39.0>>39.0 on the original price of the jeans.",
