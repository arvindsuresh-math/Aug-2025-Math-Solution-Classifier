  "flawed_nl_solution": "The jeans were on sale for 20% = 20 / 100 = 1 /5 off, so the sale took 125 / 5 = $<<125/5=25>>25 off.\nThus, after the sale, the jeans cost $125 - $25 = $<<125-25=100>>100.\nTodd's coupon lowered the price to $100 - $10 = $<<100-10=90>>90.\nThe store credit card gave him 10% = 10 / 100 = 1 / 10 off, so the card took $90 / 10 = $<<90/10=9>>9 off.\nThus, he paid $90 - $9 = $<<90-9=81>>81 for the jeans.\nTherefore, Todd saved $125 - $81 = $<<125-81=42>>42 on the original price of the jeans.\n#### 42",
