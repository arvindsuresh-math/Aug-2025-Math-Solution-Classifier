  "flawed_nl_solution": "Half of the students are playing basketball, which means 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students play basketball.\nTwo-fifths plays volleyball, which leaves us with 20 * 2/5 = <<20*2/5=8>>8 students.\nOne-tenth play both games, which means 20 * 1/10 = <<20*1/10=2>>2 students.\nThere are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 students who play basketball or volleyball.\nAmong these 18 students, 2 of them are playing both games, so that means 18 - 2 = <<18-2=19>>19 students play only one of the two games.\nSo finally, 20 - 19 = <<20-19=1>>1 students do not play either game.\n#### 1",
