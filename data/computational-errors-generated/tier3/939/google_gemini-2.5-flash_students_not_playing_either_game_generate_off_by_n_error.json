  "flawed_nl_solution": "Half of the students are playing basketball, which means 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10.0>>10.0 students play basketball.\nTwo-fifths plays volleyball, which leaves us with 20 * 2/5 = <<20*2/5=8>>8 students.\nOne-tenth play both games, which means 20 * 1/10 = <<20*1/10=2>>2 students.\nThere are 10.0 + 8 = <<10.0+8=18.0>>18.0 students who play basketball or volleyball.\nAmong these 18.0 students, 2 of them are playing both games, so that means 18.0 - 2 = <<18.0-2=16.0>>16.0 students play only one of the two games.\nSo finally, 20 - 16.0 = <<20-16.0=1.0>>1.0 students do not play either game.",
