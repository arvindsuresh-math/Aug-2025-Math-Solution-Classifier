  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how much water beans take by multiplying the water use for corn by 2: 20 gallons/acre * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 gallons/acre\nNext, calculate Bob's water use by multiplying each plant's water use per acre by the number of acres he planted, then adding up the total water use for all three crops: 3 * 20 + 9 * 80 + 12 * 40 = <<3*20+9*80+12*40=1260>>1260\nNow do the same thing for Brenda: 6 * 20 + 7 * 80 + 14 * 40 = <<6*20+7*80+14*40=1240>>1240\nAnd do the same thing for Bernie: 2 * 20 + 12 * 80 = 1000\nNow add up each farmer's water use to find the total water use: 1260 + 1240 + 1000 = <<1260+1240+1000=350>>350\nNow divide Bob's water use by the total water use and multiply by 100 to find what percentage of the water he used: 1260 / 350 * 100 = <<1260/350*100=360.0>>360.0%",
