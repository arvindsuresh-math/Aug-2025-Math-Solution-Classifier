  "flawed_nl_solution": "As pajama sets are made up of a top and a bottom, there are 4 pajama sets * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 articles of clothing from Adam's donation.\nIn total, Adam is donating 4 pairs of pants + 4 jumpers + 8 pajama pieces + 20 t-shirts = <<4+4+8+20=34>>34 articles of clothing.\nTogether, the 3 friends donate a total of 34 articles of clothing per friend * 3 friends = <<34*3=102>>102 articles of clothing.\nAdam changes his mind and takes back half, which means he is now actually donating 34 / 2 = <<34/2=17>>17 articles of clothing.\nThere is therefore now a total of 102 + 17 = <<102+17=119>>119 articles of clothing being donated.",
