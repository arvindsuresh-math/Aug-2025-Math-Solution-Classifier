  "flawed_nl_solution": "Joshua made 20 + 6 = <<20+6=30>>30 macarons.\nMiles made 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 macarons.\nThree-fourths of Miles' macarons is 60 x 3/4 = <<60*3/4=45>>45.\nSo Renz made 45 - 1 = <<45-1=44>>44 macarons.\nThe four of them have a total of 20 + 30 + 60 + 44 = <<20+30+60+44=154>>154 macarons combined.\nThus, 154/2 = <<154/2=77>>77 kids would receive 2 macarons each.\n#### 77",
