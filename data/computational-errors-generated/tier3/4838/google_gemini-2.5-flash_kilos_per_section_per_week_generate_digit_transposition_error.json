  "flawed_nl_solution": "In a week, each section collected 280/2 = <<280/2=104>>104 kilos of newspapers.\nSo, in three weeks, one section collected 104 x 3 = <<104*3=312>>312 kilos.\nSo, the 4 sections collected a total of 312 x 4 = <<312*4=1248>>1248 kilos.\nHence, their target is to collect 1248 + 320 = <<1248+320=1568>>1568 kilos of the newspaper.\n#### 1568",
