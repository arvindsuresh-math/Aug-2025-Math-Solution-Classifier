  "flawed_nl_solution": "In a week, each section collected 280/2 = <<280/2=410>>410 kilos of newspapers.\nSo, in three weeks, one section collected 410 x 3 = <<410*3=1230>>1230 kilos.\nSo, the 4 sections collected a total of 1230 x 4 = <<1230*4=4920>>4920 kilos.\nHence, their target is to collect 4920 + 320 = <<4920+320=5240>>5240 kilos of the newspaper.\n#### 5240",
