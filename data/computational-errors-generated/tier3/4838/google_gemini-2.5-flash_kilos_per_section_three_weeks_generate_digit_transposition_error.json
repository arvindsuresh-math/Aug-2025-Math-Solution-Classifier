  "flawed_nl_solution": "In a week, each section collected 280/2 = <<280/2=140>>140 kilos of newspapers.\nSo, in three weeks, one section collected 140 x 3 = <<140*3=240>>240 kilos.\nSo, the 4 sections collected a total of 240 x 4 = <<240*4=960>>960 kilos.\nHence, their target is to collect 960 + 320 = <<960+320=1280>>1280 kilos of the newspaper.\n#### 1280",
