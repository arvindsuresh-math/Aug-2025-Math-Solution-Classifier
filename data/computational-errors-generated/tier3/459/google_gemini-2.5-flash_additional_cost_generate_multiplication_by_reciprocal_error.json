  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the price of a lawnmower was $1800 a year ago, 2/5 less than the cost right now, then it now costs 2/5*1800 = <<2/5*1800=9000/2>>$9000/2 more to buy one lawnmower.\nThe total cost of buying one lawnmower right now is $1800+$9000/2 = $<<1800+9000/2=6300>>6300\nTo purchase 4 such lawnmowers, Mr. Lucian will have to pay $6300*4 = $<<6300*4=25200>>25200",
