  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=1200>>1200 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+1200=<<2400+1200=360>>360 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 360/3=<<360/3=120>>120 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 360-120=<<360-120=240>>240 remaining bottles of wine.",
