  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=120>>120 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+120=<<2400+120=2520>>2520 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 2520/3=<<2520/3=840>>840 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 2520-840=<<2520-840=1680>>1680 remaining bottles of wine.\n#### 1680",
