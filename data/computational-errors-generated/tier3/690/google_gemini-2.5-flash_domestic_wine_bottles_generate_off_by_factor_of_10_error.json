  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=12000.0>>12000.0 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+12000.0=<<2400+12000.0=14400.0>>14400.0 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 14400.0/3=<<14400.0/3=4800.0>>4800.0 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 14400.0-4800.0=<<14400.0-4800.0=9600.0>>9600.0 remaining bottles of wine.",
