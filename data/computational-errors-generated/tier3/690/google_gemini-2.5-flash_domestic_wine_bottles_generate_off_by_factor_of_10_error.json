  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=12000>>12000 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+12000=<<2400+12000=14400>>14400 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 14400/3=<<14400/3=4800>>4800 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 14400-4800=<<14400-4800=9600>>9600 remaining bottles of wine.",
