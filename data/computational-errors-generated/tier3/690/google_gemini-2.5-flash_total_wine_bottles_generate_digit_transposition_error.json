  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=1200.0>>1200.0 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+1200.0=<<2400+1200.0=6300.0>>6300.0 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 6300.0/3=<<6300.0/3=2100.0>>2100.0 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 6300.0-2100.0=<<6300.0-2100.0=4200.0>>4200.0 remaining bottles of wine.",
