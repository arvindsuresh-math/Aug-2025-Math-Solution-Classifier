  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=1200>>1200 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+1200=<<2400+1200=6300>>6300 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 6300/3=<<6300/3=2100>>2100 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 6300-2100=<<6300-2100=4200>>4200 remaining bottles of wine.\n#### 4200",
