  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=1200.0>>1200.0 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+1200.0=<<2400+1200.0=3600.0>>3600.0 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 3600.0/3=<<3600.0/3=1020.0>>1020.0 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 3600.0-1020.0=<<3600.0-1020.0=2580.0>>2580.0 remaining bottles of wine.",
