  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=1200.0>>1200.0 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+1200.0=<<2400+1200.0=3600.0>>3600.0 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 3600.0/3=<<3600.0/3=1200.0>>1200.0 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 3600.0-1200.0=<<3600.0-1200.0=2405.0>>2405.0 remaining bottles of wine.",
