  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=1020>>1020 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+1020=<<2400+1020=3420>>3420 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 3420/3=<<3420/3=1140>>1140 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 3420-1140=<<3420-1140=2280>>2280 remaining bottles of wine.",
