  "flawed_nl_solution": "Randy has 20 - 12 = <<20-12=4>>4 years until he is 20.\nHe must practice 10000 hours / 4 years = <<10000/4=2500>>2500 hours a year to become an expert.\nThere are 52 weeks in a year - 2 weeks of vacation Randy plans to take = <<52-2=50>>50 weeks of practice for Randy.\nRandy will practice Monday - Friday, which is 5 days a week, so 50 weeks x 5 days = <<50*5=250>>250 days of practice each year.\nRandy will need to practice 2500 hours / 250 days = <<2500/250=10>>10 hours each day.\n#### 10",
