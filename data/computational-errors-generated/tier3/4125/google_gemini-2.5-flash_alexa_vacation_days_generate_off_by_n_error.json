  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in one week so one week and 2 days = 7+2 = <<7+2=11>>11 days\nIf we multiply both sides of this equation by 4/3, we get e = (4/3)*11 days = <<(4/3)*11=44/3>>44/3 days\nJoey spent half of 44/3 days which is 44/3/2 = <<44/3/2=22/3>>22/3 days to learn swimming\n#### 22/3",
