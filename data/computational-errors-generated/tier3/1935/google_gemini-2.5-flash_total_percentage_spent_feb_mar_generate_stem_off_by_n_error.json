  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 90%.\nThis means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 90% = 10% of her savings.\nReese had $2900 + $1500 = $<<2900+1500=4400>>4400 for the April expenses and the money left in her account.\nSo, $4400 is equal to 10% which means every 1% is equal to $4400/10 = $<<4400/10=440>>440.\nTherefore, Reese originally had $440 x 100 = $<<440*100=44000>>44000 in her savings account.\n#### 44000",
