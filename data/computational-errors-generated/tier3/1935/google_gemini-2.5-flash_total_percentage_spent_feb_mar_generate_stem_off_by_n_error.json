  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 80%.\nThis means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 80% = 20% of her savings.\nReese had $2900 + $1500 = $<<2900+1500=4400>>4400 for the April expenses and the money left in her account.\nSo, $4400 is equal to 20% which means every 1% is equal to $4400/20 = $<<4400/20=220.0>>220.0.\nTherefore, Reese originally had $220.0 x 100 = $<<220.0*100=22000.0>>22000.0 in her savings account.",
