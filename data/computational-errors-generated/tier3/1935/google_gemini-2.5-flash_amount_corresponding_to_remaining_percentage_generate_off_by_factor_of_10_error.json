  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60%.\nThis means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 60% = 40% of her savings.\nReese had $2900 + $1500 = $<<2900+1500=44000>>44000 for the April expenses and the money left in her account.\nSo, $44000 is equal to 40% which means every 1% is equal to $44000/40 = $<<44000/40=1100>>1100.\nTherefore, Reese originally had $1100 x 100 = $<<1100*100=110000>>110000 in her savings account.",
