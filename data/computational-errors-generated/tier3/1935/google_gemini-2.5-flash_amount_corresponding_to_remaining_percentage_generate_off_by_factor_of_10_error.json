  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60%.\nThis means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 60% = 40% of her savings.\nReese had $2900 + $1500 = $<<2900+1500=440>>440 for the April expenses and the money left in her account.\nSo, $440 is equal to 40% which means every 1% is equal to $440/40 = $<<440/40=11.0>>11.0.\nTherefore, Reese originally had $11.0 x 100 = $<<11.0*100=1100.0>>1100.0 in her savings account.",
