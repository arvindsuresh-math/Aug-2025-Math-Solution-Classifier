  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60%.\nThis means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 60% = 50% of her savings.\nReese had $2900 + $1500 = $<<2900+1500=4400>>4400 for the April expenses and the money left in her account.\nSo, $4400 is equal to 50% which means every 1% is equal to $4400/50 = $<<4400/50=88>>88.\nTherefore, Reese originally had $88 x 100 = $<<88*100=8800>>8800 in her savings account.\n#### 8800",
