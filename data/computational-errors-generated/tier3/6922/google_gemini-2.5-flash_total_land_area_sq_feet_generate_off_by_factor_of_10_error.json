  "flawed_nl_solution": "One square yard is the same as 3 feet by 3 feet, or 3*3=<<1*3*3=9>>9 square feet.\nTen square yards is 9*10=<<10*9=90>>90 square feet.\nTherefore, 100 rabbits can clear 100*90=<<100*90=9000>>9000 square feet of grassland per day.\nA 200 ft by 900 ft area is 200*900=<<200*900=18000>>18000 square feet.\nThus, 18000 sq ft can be cleared by 100 rabbits in 18000/9000=<<18000/9000=2>>2 days\n#### 2",
