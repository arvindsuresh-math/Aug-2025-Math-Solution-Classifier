  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $<<133/7=91>>91.\nThe total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $91 x 100 = $<<91*100=9100>>9100 is her monthly earnings.\nSo, $9100/2 = $<<9100/2=4550>>4550 is spent on her other monthly expenses.\nThe total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $4550 = $<<133+4550=4683>>4683.\nHence, she saves $9100 - $4683 = $<<9100-4683=4417>>4417 per month.\n#### 4417",
