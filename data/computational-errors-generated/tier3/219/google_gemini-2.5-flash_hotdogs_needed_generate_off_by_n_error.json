  "flawed_nl_solution": "Joey Chestnut ate 75 hotdogs to claim the record and Lisa has eaten 20 hot dogs so far, so she still needs to eat 75-20=<<75-20=60>>60 hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut.\nLisa has a 10 minute time period to eat the hotdogs and half the time has already passed, which means Lisa has 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 minutes left until the competition is over.\nIf she needs to eat 60 hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut and there are 5 minutes left in the competition period then she needs to eat 60/5=<<60/5=12>>12 hot dogs per minute to have a chance of tying for a win.\n#### 12",
