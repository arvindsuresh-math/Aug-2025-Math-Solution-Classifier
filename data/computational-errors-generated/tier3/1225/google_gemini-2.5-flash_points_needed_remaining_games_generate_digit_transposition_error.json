  "flawed_nl_solution": "At this point in the season, Donovan has scored 26 * 15 = <<26*15=390>>390 points.\nTo reach his goal of 30 points per game, he would have to finish the season with a total of 30 * 20 = <<30*20=600>>600 points.\nFor the remaining 5 games, Donovan needs to score 600 - 390 = <<600-390=120>>120 points.\nTherefore, he needs to average 120 / 5 = <<120/5=24>>24 points per game.\n#### 24",
