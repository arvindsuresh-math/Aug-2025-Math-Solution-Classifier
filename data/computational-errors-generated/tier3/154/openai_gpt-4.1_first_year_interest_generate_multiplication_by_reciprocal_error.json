  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Ariella has $200 more in her son's saving account than Daniella has, then she has $400 + $200 = $600\nIf she earns an interest of 10% in the first year, her savings account increases by 1/10 * $600 = $<<1/10*600=6000>>6000\nIn the second year, she earns the same amount of interest, which $6000 + $6000 = $<<6000+6000=12000>>12000\nThe total amount of money in Ariella's account after two years is $600 + $12000 = $<<600+12000=12600>>12600",
