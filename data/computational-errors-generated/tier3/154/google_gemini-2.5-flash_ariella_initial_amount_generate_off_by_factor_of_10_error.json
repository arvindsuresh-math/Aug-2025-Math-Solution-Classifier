  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Ariella has $200 more in her son's saving account than Daniella has, then she has $400 + $200 = $6000\nIf she earns an interest of 10% in the first year, her savings account increases by 10/100 * $6000 = $<<10/100*6000=600>>600\nIn the second year, she earns the same amount of interest, which $600 + $600 = $<<600+600=1200>>1200\nThe total amount of money in Ariella's account after two years is $6000 + $1200 = $<<6000+1200=7200>>7200\n#### 7200",
