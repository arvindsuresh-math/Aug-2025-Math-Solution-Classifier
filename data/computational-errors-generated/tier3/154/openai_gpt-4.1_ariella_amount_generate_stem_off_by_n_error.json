  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Ariella has $200 more in her son's saving account than Daniella has, then she has $400 + $200 = $580\nIf she earns an interest of 10% in the first year, her savings account increases by 10/100 * $580 = $<<10/100*580=58>>58\nIn the second year, she earns the same amount of interest, which $58 + $58 = $<<58+58=116>>116\nThe total amount of money in Ariella's account after two years is $580 + $116 = $<<580+116=696>>696",
