  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Ariella has $200 more in her son's saving account than Daniella has, then she has $400 + $200 = $570\nIf she earns an interest of 10% in the first year, her savings account increases by 10/100 * $570 = $<<10/100*570=57>>57\nIn the second year, she earns the same amount of interest, which $57 + $57 = $<<57+57=114>>114\nThe total amount of money in Ariella's account after two years is $570 + $114 = $<<570+114=684>>684\n#### 684",
