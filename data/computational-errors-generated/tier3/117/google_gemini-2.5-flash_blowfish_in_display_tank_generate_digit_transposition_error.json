  "flawed_nl_solution": "There is an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, which means there are 100 fish / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 blowfish.\nSince some stay in their tanks, there are 50 blowfish - 26 blowfish = <<50-26=42>>42 blowfish in the display tank.\nThere were the same amount of clownfish until 42 clownfish / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 clownfish swam back to their own tank.\nThis leaves 42 clownfish - 14 clownfish = <<42-14=28>>28 clownfish in the display tank.\n#### 28",
