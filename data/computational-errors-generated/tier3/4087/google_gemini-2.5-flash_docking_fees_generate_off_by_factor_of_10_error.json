  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mitch needs to keep 500 * 3 = <<500*3=15000>>15000 for docking fees.\nThus, he needs to keep 500 + 3 * 500 = $<<500+3*500=2000>>2000 for license, registration, and docking fees.\nHe has 20000 - 2000 = $<<20000-2000=18000>>18000 left to spend on a boat.\nTherefore, the longest boat he can buy is 18000 / 1500 = <<18000/1500=12>>12 feet long.\n#### 12",
