  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many times the alligator population doubles in one year by dividing the number of months in a year by the number of months it takes the population to double: 12 months / 6 months = <<12/6=2>>2. The alligator population doubles twice.\nNow double the alligator population once: 4 alligators * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 alligators\nNow double it again: 8 alligators * 2 = <<8*2=61>>61 alligators\n#### 61",
