  "flawed_nl_solution": "Marnie has already eaten 5 of the chips + 5 more = <<5+5=10>>10 chips Marnie ate.\nThe bag has 100 chips in it and Marnie has only eaten 10, 100 - 10 = <<100-10=110>>110 chips left.\nIf Marnie eats 10 chips a day starting from the second day she has them, it will take her 110 chips in the bag / 10 chips Marine eats a day = <<110/10=11>>11 days to eat the whole bag.\nHowever, Marnie also ate chips on the first day she bought them, so 11 + 1 = <<11+1=12>>12 days to eat the whole bag.",
