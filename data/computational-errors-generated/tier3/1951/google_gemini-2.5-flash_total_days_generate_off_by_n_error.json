  "flawed_nl_solution": "Marnie has already eaten 5 of the chips + 5 more = <<5+5=10>>10 chips Marnie ate.\nThe bag has 100 chips in it and Marnie has only eaten 10, 100 - 10 = <<100-10=90>>90 chips left.\nIf Marnie eats 10 chips a day starting from the second day she has them, it will take her 90 chips in the bag / 10 chips Marine eats a day = <<90/10=9.0>>9.0 days to eat the whole bag.\nHowever, Marnie also ate chips on the first day she bought them, so 9.0 + 1 = <<9.0+1=13.0>>13.0 days to eat the whole bag.",
