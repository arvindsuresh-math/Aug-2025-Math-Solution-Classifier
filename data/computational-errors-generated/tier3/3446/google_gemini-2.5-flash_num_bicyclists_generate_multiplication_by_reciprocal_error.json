  "flawed_nl_solution": "If 3/5 of the people in the race are riding bicycles, their number is 3/5 * 40 people = <<3/5*40=200/3>>200/3 people\nSince a bicycle has 2 wheels, and 200/3 people were riding on a bicycle each, the total number of bicycle wheels in the race is 2 wheels/bike * 200/3 bikes = <<2*200/3=400/3>>400/3 wheels\nThe number of racers on tricycles is 40 people - 200/3 people = <<40-200/3=-80/3>>-80/3 people\nSince a tricycle has 3 wheels, and -80/3 people were riding on a tricycle each, the total number of tricycle wheels in the race is 3 wheels/trike * -80/3 trikes = <<3*-80/3=-80>>-80 wheels\nThe combined total for bicycle and tricycle wheels in the race is 400/3 wheels + -80 wheels = <<400/3+-80=160/3>>160/3 wheels\n#### 160/3",
