  "flawed_nl_solution": "First convert the total length of the journey from kilometers to meters: 9 kilometers * 1000 meters/kilometer = <<9*1000=900>>900 meters\nThen divide this by the length of one step to find the number of steps in the journey: 900 meters / 3 meters/step = <<900/3=300.0>>300.0 steps\nThen multiply the number of steps by the number of flowers per step to find how many flowers one unicorn creates on the journey: 300.0 steps * 4 flowers/step = <<300.0*4=1200.0>>1200.0 flowers\nThen multiply the number of flowers per unicorn by the number of unicorns to find the total number of flowers created: 1200.0 flowers/unicorn * 6 unicorns = 7200.0 flowers",
