  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many apples total are needed for one pint of cider: 20 golden delicious/pint + 40 pink lady/pint = <<20+40=50>>50 apples/pint\nThen multiply that number by 8 to find the number of apples needed for a gallon of cider: 50 apples/pint * 8 pints/gallon = <<50*8=400>>400 apples/gallon\nNow find how many apples per hour all 6 farmhands pick: 240 apples/hour/farmhand * 6 farmhands = <<240*6=1440>>1440 apples/hour\nThen multiply that amount by the number of hours worked to find the total number of apples gathered: 1440 apples/hour * 5 hours = <<1440*5=7200>>7200 apples\nDivide the total number of apples gathered by the number of apples used by gallon to find the number of gallons of cider made: 7200 apples / 400 apples/gallon = <<7200/400=18>>18 gallons\nSince there are 8 pints in a gallon, the final answer is 18 gallons * 8 pints / gallon = <<18*8=144>>144 pints\n#### 144",
