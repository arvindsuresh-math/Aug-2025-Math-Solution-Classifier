  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many cherries Jerry can pick in one hour: 300 cherries / 2 hours = <<300/2=150>>150 cherries/hour\nThen multiply the number of quarts of syrup by the number of cherries per quart to find the total number of quarts Jerry needs: 500 cherries/quart * 9 quarts = 4500 cherries\nThen divide the total number of cherries by the number of cherries he picks per hour to find the number of hours the cherry-picking takes: 4500 cherries / 150 cherries/hour = <<4500/150=30>>30 hours\nThen add the time it takes him to make the syrup to find the total time: 30 hours + 3 hours = <<30+3=38>>38 hours\n#### 38",
