  "flawed_nl_solution": "If it took Hadassah 6 hours to paint 12 paintings, then she paints 12/6 = <<12/6=2>>2 paintings in an hour.\nIf 2 paintings take an hour to complete, 20 paintings will take 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 hours.\nThe total time she took to finish all the paintings is 10+6 = <<10+6=61>>61 hours.",
