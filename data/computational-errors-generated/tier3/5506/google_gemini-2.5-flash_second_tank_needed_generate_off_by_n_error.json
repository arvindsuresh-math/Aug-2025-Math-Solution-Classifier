  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since 450 liters represents 45%, then each 1% is equal to 450 liters/45 = <<450/45=10>>10 liters.\nHence, the capacity of each tank is 10 liters x 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1000 liters.\nSo, the first tank needs 1000 - 300 = <<1000-300=700>>700 liters of water more.\nWhile the second tank needs 1000 - 450 = <<1000-450=555>>555 liters more.\nTherefore, 700 + 555 = <<700+555=1255>>1255 liters of water are needed to fill the two tanks.\n#### 1255",
