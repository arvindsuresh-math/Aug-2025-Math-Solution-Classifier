  "flawed_nl_solution": "Rick's savings are half the price of the gift, which is $250/2 = $<<250/2=125>>125.\nThe total savings for the two siblings is $155 + $125 = $<<155+125=283>>283.\nMom's gift costs $250 + $25 for the cake = $<<250+25=275>>275\nSubtracting the total cost of the gift from the total savings, we get $283 - $275 = $<<283-275=8>>8 left.\n#### 8",
