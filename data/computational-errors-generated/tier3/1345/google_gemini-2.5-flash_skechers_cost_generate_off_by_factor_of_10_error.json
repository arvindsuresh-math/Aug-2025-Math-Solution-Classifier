  "flawed_nl_solution": "The Adidas purchase was 1/5 that of Skechers, therefore the Skechers cost 5 * 600 = 300 dollars.\nSpending 3 times the cost of Adidas on Nike sneakers translates to 3 * 600 = <<3*600=1800>>1800 dollars.\nAll together, the three athletic-sneaker purchases cost Mimi 600 + 1800 + 300 = <<600+1800+300=2700>>2700 dollars.\nSubtracting the amount spent on athletic sneakers from the total spent gives 8000 - 2700 = <<8000-2700=5300>>5300 dollars.\n#### 5300",
