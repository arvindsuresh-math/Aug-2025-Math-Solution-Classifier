  "flawed_nl_solution": "The Adidas purchase was 1/5 that of Skechers, therefore the Skechers cost 5 * 600 = 3000 dollars.\nSpending 3 times the cost of Adidas on Nike sneakers translates to 3 * 600 = <<3*600=1800>>1800 dollars.\nAll together, the three athletic-sneaker purchases cost Mimi 600 + 1800 + 3000 = <<600+1800+3000=5410>>5410 dollars.\nSubtracting the amount spent on athletic sneakers from the total spent gives 8000 - 5410 = <<8000-5410=2590>>2590 dollars.\n#### 2590",
