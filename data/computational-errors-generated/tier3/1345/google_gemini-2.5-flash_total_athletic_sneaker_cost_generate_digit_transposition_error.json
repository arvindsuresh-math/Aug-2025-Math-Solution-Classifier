  "flawed_nl_solution": "The Adidas purchase was 1/5 that of Skechers, therefore the Skechers cost 5 * 600 = 3000 dollars.\nSpending 3 times the cost of Adidas on Nike sneakers translates to 3 * 600 = <<3*600=1800>>1800 dollars.\nAll together, the three athletic-sneaker purchases cost Mimi 600 + 1800 + 3000 = <<600+1800+3000=4500>>4500 dollars.\nSubtracting the amount spent on athletic sneakers from the total spent gives 8000 - 4500 = <<8000-4500=3500>>3500 dollars.\n#### 3500",
