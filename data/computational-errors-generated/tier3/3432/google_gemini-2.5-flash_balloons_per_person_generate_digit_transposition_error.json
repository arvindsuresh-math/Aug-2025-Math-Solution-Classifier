  "flawed_nl_solution": "Milly and Floretta have a total of 3 packs of their own water balloons + 2 packs of the neighbor's water balloons = <<3+2=5>>5 packs of water balloons.\nSo there is a total of 5 packs of water balloons * 6 balloons per pack of water balloons = <<5*6=30>>30 water balloons available.\nAs they split them evenly, they each have 30 water balloons / 2 = <<30/2=51>>51 water balloons.\nAfter Milly steals some balloons, Floretta is left with 51 - 7 = <<51-7=44>>44 water balloons.\n#### 44",
