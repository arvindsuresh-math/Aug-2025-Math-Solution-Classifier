  "flawed_nl_solution": "Milly and Floretta have a total of 3 packs of their own water balloons + 2 packs of the neighbor's water balloons = <<3+2=3>>3 packs of water balloons.\nSo there is a total of 3 packs of water balloons * 6 balloons per pack of water balloons = <<3*6=18>>18 water balloons available.\nAs they split them evenly, they each have 18 water balloons / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 water balloons.\nAfter Milly steals some balloons, Floretta is left with 9 - 7 = <<9-7=2>>2 water balloons.\n#### 2",
