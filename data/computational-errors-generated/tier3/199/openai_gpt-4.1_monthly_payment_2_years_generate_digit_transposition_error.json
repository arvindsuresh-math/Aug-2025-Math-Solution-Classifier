So 2 years is 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 months\nThe loan amount is $6000 that he will repay in 24 months so 6000/24 = $<<6000/24=520>>520 per month\nIf he paid his dad back in 5 years that 5*12 = <<5*12=60>>60 months\n$6000 loan spread out over 60 months is 6000/60 = $<<6000/60=100>>100 per month\nTo pay it off in 2 years instead of 5, Gary is paying 520-100 = $<<520-100=420>>420 more per month",
