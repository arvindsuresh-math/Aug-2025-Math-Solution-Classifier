  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total weight of the boxes is 100 boxes x 100 kg/box = 10000 kg.\nThe total weight of the crates is 10 crates x 60 kg/crate = <<10*60=600>>600 kg.\nThe total weight of the sacks is 50 sacks x 50 kg/sack = 2500 kg.\nSo, the total weight of the supplies that were already loaded is 10000 kg+ 600 kg + 2500 kg = <<10000+600+2500=13100>>13100 kg.\nHence, the most weight that can still be loaded in the truck is 13500 kg - 13100 kg = <<13500-13100=4000>>4000 kg.\nThis means 4000 kg / 40 kg/bag = <<4000/40=100>>100 bags can still be loaded in the truck.\n#### 100",
