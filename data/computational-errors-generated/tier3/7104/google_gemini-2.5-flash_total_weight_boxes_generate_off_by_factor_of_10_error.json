  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total weight of the boxes is 100 boxes x 100 kg/box = 1000 kg.\nThe total weight of the crates is 10 crates x 60 kg/crate = <<10*60=600>>600 kg.\nThe total weight of the sacks is 50 sacks x 50 kg/sack = 2500 kg.\nSo, the total weight of the supplies that were already loaded is 1000 kg+ 600 kg + 2500 kg = <<1000+600+2500=4100>>4100 kg.\nHence, the most weight that can still be loaded in the truck is 13500 kg - 4100 kg = <<13500-4100=9400>>9400 kg.\nThis means 9400 kg / 40 kg/bag = <<9400/40=235>>235 bags can still be loaded in the truck.\n#### 235",
