  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total weight of the boxes is 100 boxes x 100 kg/box = 10000 kg.\nThe total weight of the crates is 10 crates x 60 kg/crate = <<10*60=600>>600 kg.\nThe total weight of the sacks is 50 sacks x 50 kg/sack = 2500 kg.\nSo, the total weight of the supplies that were already loaded is 10000 kg+ 600 kg + 2500 kg = <<10000+600+2500=11300>>11300 kg.\nHence, the most weight that can still be loaded in the truck is 13500 kg - 11300 kg = <<13500-11300=2200>>2200 kg.\nThis means 2200 kg / 40 kg/bag = <<2200/40=55>>55 bags can still be loaded in the truck.\n#### 55",
