  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each dog consumes 250 grams x 2 = <<250*2=500>>500 grams of dog food each day.\nSo, 4 dogs consume 500 grams x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 grams of dog food each day.\nSince there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, then the 4 dogs can consume 2000/1000 = <<2000/1000=2>>2 kilograms of dog food each day.\nAunt Gemma bought a total of 50 kilograms x 2 = <<50*2=1000>>1000 kilograms of dog food.\nHence, it will last 1000 kilograms/2 kilograms = <<1000/2=500>>500 days.\n#### 500",
