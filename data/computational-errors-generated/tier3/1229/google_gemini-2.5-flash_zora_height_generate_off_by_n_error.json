  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Brixton has the same height as Zara which is 64 inches, Zora, who is 8 inches shorter than Brixton, is 64-8 = <<64-8=54>>54 inches tall.\nZara and Brixton's height is 64+64 = <<64+64=128>>128 inches\nIf you add Zora's height, the three have a total height of 128+54 = <<128+54=182>>182\nItzayana is 4 inches taller than Zoran which means she is 54+4 = 58 inches tall\nThe total height of the four friends is 58+182 =<<58+182=240>>240\nThe average height of the three is 240/4 =<<240/4=60>>60\n#### 60",
