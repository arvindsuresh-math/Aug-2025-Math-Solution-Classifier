  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Brixton has the same height as Zara which is 64 inches, Zora, who is 8 inches shorter than Brixton, is 64-8 = <<64-8=52>>52 inches tall.\nZara and Brixton's height is 64+64 = <<64+64=128>>128 inches\nIf you add Zora's height, the three have a total height of 128+52 = <<128+52=180>>180\nItzayana is 4 inches taller than Zoran which means she is 52+4 = 56 inches tall\nThe total height of the four friends is 56+180 =<<56+180=236>>236\nThe average height of the three is 236/4 =<<236/4=59.0>>59.0",
