  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Brixton has the same height as Zara which is 64 inches, Zora, who is 8 inches shorter than Brixton, is 64-8 = <<64-8=60>>60 inches tall.\nZara and Brixton's height is 64+64 = <<64+64=128>>128 inches\nIf you add Zora's height, the three have a total height of 128+60 = <<128+60=188>>188\nItzayana is 4 inches taller than Zoran which means she is 60+4 = 64 inches tall\nThe total height of the four friends is 64+188 =<<64+188=252>>252\nThe average height of the three is 252/4 =<<252/4=63>>63\n#### 63",
