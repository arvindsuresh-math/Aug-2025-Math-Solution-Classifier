  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Brixton has the same height as Zara which is 64 inches, Zora, who is 8 inches shorter than Brixton, is 64-8 = <<64-8=56>>56 inches tall.\nZara and Brixton's height is 64+64 = <<64+64=128>>128 inches\nIf you add Zora's height, the three have a total height of 128+56 = <<128+56=184>>184\nItzayana is 4 inches taller than Zoran which means she is 56+4 = 56 inches tall\nThe total height of the four friends is 56+184 =<<56+184=240>>240\nThe average height of the three is 240/4 =<<240/4=60>>60\n#### 60",
