  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dr. Jones pays $6000 / 4 =$ <<6000/4=1500>>1500 for his electric and water bill.\nHe pays $6000 / 5 = $<<6000/5=1200>>1200 for his insurances.\nThe total amount he pays for the bills and insurances is $1500 + $1200 = $<<1500+1200=270>>270.\nThe remaining money from his earning after paying off the bills and insurance is $6000 - $270 = $<<6000-270=5730>>5730.\nThe total amount he needs to pay for the rent and food expenses is $640 + $380 = $<<640+380=1020>>1020.\nSo, Dr. Jones has $5730 - $1020 = $<<5730-1020=4710>>4710 left\n#### 4710",
