  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dr. Jones pays $6000 / 4 =$ <<6000/4=1500.0>>1500.0 for his electric and water bill.\nHe pays $6000 / 5 = $<<6000/5=1200.0>>1200.0 for his insurances.\nThe total amount he pays for the bills and insurances is $1500.0 + $1200.0 = $<<1500.0+1200.0=2070.0>>2070.0.\nThe remaining money from his earning after paying off the bills and insurance is $6000 - $2070.0 = $<<6000-2070.0=3930.0>>3930.0.\nThe total amount he needs to pay for the rent and food expenses is $640 + $380 = $<<640+380=1020>>1020.\nSo, Dr. Jones has $3930.0 - $1020 = $<<3930.0-1020=2910.0>>2910.0 left",
