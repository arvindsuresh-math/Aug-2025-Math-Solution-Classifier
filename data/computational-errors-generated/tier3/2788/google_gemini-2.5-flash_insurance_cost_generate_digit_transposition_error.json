  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dr. Jones pays $6000 / 4 =$ <<6000/4=1500>>1500 for his electric and water bill.\nHe pays $6000 / 5 = $<<6000/5=1020>>1020 for his insurances.\nThe total amount he pays for the bills and insurances is $1500 + $1020 = $<<1500+1020=2520>>2520.\nThe remaining money from his earning after paying off the bills and insurance is $6000 - $2520 = $<<6000-2520=3480>>3480.\nThe total amount he needs to pay for the rent and food expenses is $640 + $380 = $<<640+380=1020>>1020.\nSo, Dr. Jones has $3480 - $1020 = $<<3480-1020=2460>>2460 left\n#### 2460",
