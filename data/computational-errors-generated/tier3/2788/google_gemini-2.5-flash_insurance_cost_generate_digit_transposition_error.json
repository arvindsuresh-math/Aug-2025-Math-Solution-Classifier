  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dr. Jones pays $6000 / 4 =$ <<6000/4=1500.0>>1500.0 for his electric and water bill.\nHe pays $6000 / 5 = $<<6000/5=2100.0>>2100.0 for his insurances.\nThe total amount he pays for the bills and insurances is $1500.0 + $2100.0 = $<<1500.0+2100.0=3600.0>>3600.0.\nThe remaining money from his earning after paying off the bills and insurance is $6000 - $3600.0 = $<<6000-3600.0=2400.0>>2400.0.\nThe total amount he needs to pay for the rent and food expenses is $640 + $380 = $<<640+380=1020>>1020.\nSo, Dr. Jones has $2400.0 - $1020 = $<<2400.0-1020=1380.0>>1380.0 left",
