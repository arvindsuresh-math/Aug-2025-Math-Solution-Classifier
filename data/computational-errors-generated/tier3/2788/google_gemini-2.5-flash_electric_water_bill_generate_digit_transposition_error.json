  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dr. Jones pays $6000 / 4 =$ <<6000/4=1050.0>>1050.0 for his electric and water bill.\nHe pays $6000 / 5 = $<<6000/5=1200.0>>1200.0 for his insurances.\nThe total amount he pays for the bills and insurances is $1050.0 + $1200.0 = $<<1050.0+1200.0=2250.0>>2250.0.\nThe remaining money from his earning after paying off the bills and insurance is $6000 - $2250.0 = $<<6000-2250.0=3750.0>>3750.0.\nThe total amount he needs to pay for the rent and food expenses is $640 + $380 = $<<640+380=1020>>1020.\nSo, Dr. Jones has $3750.0 - $1020 = $<<3750.0-1020=2730.0>>2730.0 left",
