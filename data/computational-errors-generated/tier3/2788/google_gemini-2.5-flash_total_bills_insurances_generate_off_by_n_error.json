  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dr. Jones pays $6000 / 4 =$ <<6000/4=1500>>1500 for his electric and water bill.\nHe pays $6000 / 5 = $<<6000/5=1200>>1200 for his insurances.\nThe total amount he pays for the bills and insurances is $1500 + $1200 = $<<1500+1200=2704>>2704.\nThe remaining money from his earning after paying off the bills and insurance is $6000 - $2704 = $<<6000-2704=3296>>3296.\nThe total amount he needs to pay for the rent and food expenses is $640 + $380 = $<<640+380=1020>>1020.\nSo, Dr. Jones has $3296 - $1020 = $<<3296-1020=2276>>2276 left\n#### 2276",
