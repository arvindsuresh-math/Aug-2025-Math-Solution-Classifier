  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bus to Ryan's work takes 10 minutes longer than his bike ride, so it takes 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40 minutes.\nRyan takes the bus 3 times a week, so the bus rides take 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 minutes a week.\nHis friend cuts 2/3 off his biking time, which is 2/3*30 = <<2/3*30=90/2>>90/2 minutes a week.\nThis means his friend takes 30-90/2 = <<30-90/2=-15>>-15 minutes to drive him.\nTherefore, Ryan spends 120 + -15 + 30 = <<120+-15+30=135>>135 minutes every week commuting to work.",
