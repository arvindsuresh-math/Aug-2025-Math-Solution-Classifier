  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bus to Ryan's work takes 10 minutes longer than his bike ride, so it takes 10 + 30 = <<10+30=30>>30 minutes.\nRyan takes the bus 3 times a week, so the bus rides take 30 * 3 = <<30*3=90>>90 minutes a week.\nHis friend cuts 2/3 off his biking time, which is 2/3*30 = <<2/3*30=20>>20 minutes a week.\nThis means his friend takes 30-20 = <<30-20=10>>10 minutes to drive him.\nTherefore, Ryan spends 90 + 10 + 30 = <<90+10+30=130>>130 minutes every week commuting to work.\n#### 130",
