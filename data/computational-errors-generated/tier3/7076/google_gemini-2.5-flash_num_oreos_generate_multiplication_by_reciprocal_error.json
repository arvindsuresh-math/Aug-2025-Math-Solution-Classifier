  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio representing the number of cookies and Oreos that Zack bought is 4+9=<<4+9=13>>13\nThe fraction representing the number of Oreos Zane bought is 4/13, and since the total number of items in the box is 65, Zane bought 4/13*65=<<4/13*65=845/4>>845/4 Oreos.\nIf Zane bought 845/4 Oreos at $2 each, the total cost of buying Oreos is $2*845/4=$<<845/4*2=845/2>>845/2\nSince the total number of items in the box is 65, and there are 845/4 Oreos in the box, the number of cookies in the box is 65-845/4=<<65-845/4=-585/4>>-585/4\nThe cost of buying the cookies at $3 each is -585/4*$3=$<<-585/4*3=-1755/4>>-1755/4\nIf the Oreos cost $845/2 to buy, Zane used $-1755/4-$845/2=$-3445/4 more to buy Cookies than Oreos.\n#### -3445/4",
