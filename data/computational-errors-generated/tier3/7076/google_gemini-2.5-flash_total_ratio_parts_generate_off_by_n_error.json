  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio representing the number of cookies and Oreos that Zack bought is 4+9=<<4+9=10>>10\nThe fraction representing the number of Oreos Zane bought is 4/10, and since the total number of items in the box is 65, Zane bought 4/10*65=<<4/10*65=26>>26 Oreos.\nIf Zane bought 26 Oreos at $2 each, the total cost of buying Oreos is $2*26=$<<26*2=52>>52\nSince the total number of items in the box is 65, and there are 26 Oreos in the box, the number of cookies in the box is 65-26=<<65-26=39>>39\nThe cost of buying the cookies at $3 each is 39*$3=$<<39*3=117>>117\nIf the Oreos cost $52 to buy, Zane used $117-$52=$65 more to buy Cookies than Oreos.\n#### 65",
