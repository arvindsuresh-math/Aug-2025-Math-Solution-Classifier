  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio representing the number of cookies and Oreos that Zack bought is 4+9=<<4+9=15>>15\nThe fraction representing the number of Oreos Zane bought is 4/15, and since the total number of items in the box is 65, Zane bought 4/15*65=<<4/15*65=52/3>>52/3 Oreos.\nIf Zane bought 52/3 Oreos at $2 each, the total cost of buying Oreos is $2*52/3=$<<52/3*2=104/3>>104/3\nSince the total number of items in the box is 65, and there are 52/3 Oreos in the box, the number of cookies in the box is 65-52/3=<<65-52/3=143/3>>143/3\nThe cost of buying the cookies at $3 each is 143/3*$3=$<<143/3*3=143>>143\nIf the Oreos cost $104/3 to buy, Zane used $143-$104/3=$325/3 more to buy Cookies than Oreos.\n#### 325/3",
