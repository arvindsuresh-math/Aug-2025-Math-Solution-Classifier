  "flawed_nl_solution": "1. Tonya sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades which makes $11 + $24= $<<11+24=35>>35 for small and medium lemonades.\n2. Tonya made a total of $50. If she made $35 selling the two smaller sizes and she sold three sizes in all then $50-$35= $<<50-35=18>>18 worth of large lemonades.\n3. The large lemonades sold for $3 each and Tonya sold $18 worth of large lemonades which means she sold $18/$3=<<18/3=6>>6 large cups of lemonade.\n#### 6",
