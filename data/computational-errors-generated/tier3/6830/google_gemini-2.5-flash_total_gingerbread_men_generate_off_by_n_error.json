  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first step to find the total number of gingerbread men is to add the number with each decoration: 6 men + 9 men = <<6+9=15>>15 men\nThen subtract the number of gingerbread men with both decorations to find the total number of gingerbread men: 15 men - 3 men = <<15-3=15>>15 men\nThen divide the number of gingerbread men with red hats by the total number and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 6 men / 15 men * 100% = 40%\n#### 40",
