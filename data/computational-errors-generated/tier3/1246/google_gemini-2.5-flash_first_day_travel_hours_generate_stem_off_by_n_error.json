  "flawed_nl_solution": "On the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 10 hours + 10 hours = <<10+10=10>>10 hours traveling.\nOn the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 3 hours + 1 hours = <<3+1=4>>4 hours not moving.\nThis is a total of 10 hours traveling + 4 hours not moving = <<10+4=14>>14 hours or 1 day.\nSo the rest of the journey took place over 3 days journey - 1 first day = <<3-1=2>>2 days.\nThis is the same as 2 days * 24 hours = <<2*24=48>>48 hours.\nIn these 2 days, the spaceship's time is split into 11 hours traveling + 1 hour break = <<11+1=12>>12 hour blocks.\nSo in the last 2 days, the spaceship wasn't moving for a total of 48 hours / 12 hour blocks = <<48/12=4>>4 hours.\nAdding this to breaks from the first day shows that the spaceship was not moving for a total of 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 hours.\n#### 8",
