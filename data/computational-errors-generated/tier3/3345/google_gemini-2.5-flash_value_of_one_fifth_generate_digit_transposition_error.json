  "flawed_nl_solution": "Rica is left with 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 of her prize money which is equal to $300.\nSince 4/5 is worth $300, then 1/5 is worth $300/4 = $57.\nSo, Rica got $57 x 5 = $285 from their prize money which is 3/8 of the total prize.\nSince 3/8 is equal to $285, then 1/8 is worth $285/3 = $95.\nSo, the total prize money is $95 x 8 = $<<95*8=760>>760.\n#### 760",
