  "flawed_nl_solution": "Iris and his brother and sister were able to pick a total of 30 + 20 + 10 = <<30+20+10=50>>50 berries.\nThe rotten berries that needed to be thrown away are 1/3 x 50 = <<1/3*50=50/3>>50/3.\nSo, the total number of fresh berries is 50 - 50/3 = <<50-50/3=100/3>>100/3.\nThe berries they need to keep are 1/2 x 100/3 = <<1/2*100/3=50/3>>50/3.\nTherefore, the total number of berries they will be able to sell is 100/3 - 50/3 = <<100/3-50/3=50/3>>50/3.\n#### 50/3",
