  "flawed_nl_solution": "Iris and his brother and sister were able to pick a total of 30 + 20 + 10 = <<30+20+10=80>>80 berries.\nThe rotten berries that needed to be thrown away are 1/3 x 80 = <<1/3*80=80/3>>80/3.\nSo, the total number of fresh berries is 80 - 80/3 = <<80-80/3=160/3>>160/3.\nThe berries they need to keep are 1/2 x 160/3 = <<1/2*160/3=80/3>>80/3.\nTherefore, the total number of berries they will be able to sell is 160/3 - 80/3 = <<160/3-80/3=80/3>>80/3.\n#### 80/3",
