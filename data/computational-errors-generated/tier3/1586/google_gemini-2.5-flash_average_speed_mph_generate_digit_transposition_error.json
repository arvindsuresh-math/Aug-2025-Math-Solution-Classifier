  "flawed_nl_solution": "We first convert the time of 4 hours 20 minutes in minutes 2 hours 20 minutes = 2 * 60 + 20 = 140 minutes\nAverage speed S is given by distance / time. Hence S = 280 miles / 140 minutes = <<280/140=2.0>>2.0 mile / minute\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour so the speed is 2.0*60=210.0 miles/hour",
