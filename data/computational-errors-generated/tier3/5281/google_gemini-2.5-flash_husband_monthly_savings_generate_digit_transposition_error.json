  "flawed_nl_solution": "The husband saves $335 x 4 = $<<335*4=3140>>3140 a month.\nThe wife saves $225 x 4 = $<<225*4=900>>900 a month.\nTogether, they save $3140 + $900 = $<<3140+900=4040>>4040 in a month.\nIn 6 months, their total savings is $4040 x 6 = $<<4040*6=24240>>24240.\nHalf of the couple's savings is 24240 / 2 = $<<24240/2=12120>>12120.\nTherefore, each child will receive 12120 / 4 = $<<12120/4=3030>>3030.\n#### 3030",
