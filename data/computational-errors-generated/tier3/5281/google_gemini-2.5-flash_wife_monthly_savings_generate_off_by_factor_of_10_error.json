  "flawed_nl_solution": "The husband saves $335 x 4 = $<<335*4=1340>>1340 a month.\nThe wife saves $225 x 4 = $<<225*4=9000>>9000 a month.\nTogether, they save $1340 + $9000 = $<<1340+9000=10340>>10340 in a month.\nIn 6 months, their total savings is $10340 x 6 = $<<10340*6=62040>>62040.\nHalf of the couple's savings is 62040 / 2 = $<<62040/2=31020>>31020.\nTherefore, each child will receive 31020 / 4 = $<<31020/4=7755>>7755.\n#### 7755",
