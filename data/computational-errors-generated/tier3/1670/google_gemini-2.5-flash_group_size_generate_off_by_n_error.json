  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:1, that means for every 3 apples there is 1 orange. The size of this group is therefore 3+1=<<3+1=5>>5.\nWe then divide this group size into the total amount of fruit the basket is holding at this time, which is 40. This means there are 40/5=<<40/5=8>>8 of these groups in total.\nSince there are 8 of these groups in total, that means there are 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 oranges in the basket.\n#### 8",
