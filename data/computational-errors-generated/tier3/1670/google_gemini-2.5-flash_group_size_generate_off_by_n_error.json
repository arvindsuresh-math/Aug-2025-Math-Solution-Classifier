  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:1, that means for every 3 apples there is 1 orange. The size of this group is therefore 3+1=<<3+1=2>>2.\nWe then divide this group size into the total amount of fruit the basket is holding at this time, which is 40. This means there are 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 of these groups in total.\nSince there are 20 of these groups in total, that means there are 20*1=<<20*1=20>>20 oranges in the basket.\n#### 20",
