  "flawed_nl_solution": "From the children, there are a total of 11 children * 4 items of clothing each = <<11*4=44>>44 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\nFrom the adults, there are a total of 20 adults * 3 items of clothing each = <<20*3=60>>60 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\nSo there are a total of 44 + 60 = <<44+60=140>>140 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\nThis means that there are 140 items of clothing / 2 items of clothing per clothesline = <<140/2=70.0>>70.0 clotheslines.\nThere are 2 clotheslines per house so there must be 70.0 clotheslines / 2 = <<70.0/2=35.0>>35.0 houses on the street.",
