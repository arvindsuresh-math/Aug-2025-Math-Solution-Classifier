  "flawed_nl_solution": "Keaton can harvest his oranges every year is 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 times.\nSo the total money he earns for his oranges every year is $50 x 6 = <<50*6=300>>300.\nHe can harvest his apples 12/3= <<12/3=4>>4 times in a year.\nSo the total money he earns for the apple in a year is $30 x 4 = <<30*4=102>>102.\nTherefore, the total money he earns for his oranges and apples is $300 + $102 = $<<300+102=402>>402.\n#### 402",
