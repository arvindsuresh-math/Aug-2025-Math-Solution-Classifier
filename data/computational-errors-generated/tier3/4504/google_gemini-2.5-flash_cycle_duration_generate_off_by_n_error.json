  "flawed_nl_solution": "In 5 hours the car can drive 8 * 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 miles.\nOne cycle of driving and pause takes 5 + 1 = <<5+1=10>>10 hours.\nIn 13 hours this cycle can fit 13 / 10 = 1 full cycles with a remainder of 3 hour\n1 cycles will last for 1 * 10 = <<1*10=10>>10 hours.\nDuring 1 full cycles, the car will drive 40 * 1 = <<40*1=40>>40 miles.\nSo there is 13 - 10 = <<13-10=3>>3 remaining hour when the car can drive.\nThat means during 13 hours the car will be able to drive 40 + 8 = 48 miles.\n#### 48",
