  "flawed_nl_solution": "In 5 hours the car can drive 8 * 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 miles.\nOne cycle of driving and pause takes 5 + 1 = <<5+1=2>>2 hours.\nIn 13 hours this cycle can fit 13 / 2 = 6 full cycles with a remainder of 1 hour\n6 cycles will last for 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.\nDuring 6 full cycles, the car will drive 40 * 6 = <<40*6=240>>240 miles.\nSo there is 13 - 12 = <<13-12=1>>1 remaining hour when the car can drive.\nThat means during 13 hours the car will be able to drive 240 + 8 = 248 miles.\n#### 248",
