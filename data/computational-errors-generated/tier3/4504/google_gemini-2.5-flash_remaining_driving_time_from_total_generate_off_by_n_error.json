  "flawed_nl_solution": "In 5 hours the car can drive 8 * 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 miles.\nOne cycle of driving and pause takes 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 hours.\nIn 13 hours this cycle can fit 13 / 6 = 2 full cycles with a remainder of 1 hour\n2 cycles will last for 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 hours.\nDuring 2 full cycles, the car will drive 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 miles.\nSo there is 13 - 12 = <<13-12=3>>3 remaining hour when the car can drive.\nThat means during 13 hours the car will be able to drive 80 + 8 = 88 miles.\n#### 88",
