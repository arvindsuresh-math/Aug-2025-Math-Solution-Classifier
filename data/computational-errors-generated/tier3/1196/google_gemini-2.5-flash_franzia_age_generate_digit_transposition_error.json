  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the Franzia wine brand is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi, then the Carlo Rosi is 3*40 = <<3*40=210>>210 years old.\nThe total number of years the Carlo Rosi and the Franzia wine brands have been around is 210+40 = <<210+40=250>>250 years\nThe Carlo Rosi is four times older than the Twin Valley wine brand, meaning the Twin valley wine brand is 40/4 = <<40/4=10.0>>10.0 years old.\nTogether, the three bands have a total of 10.0+250 = <<10.0+250=260.0>>260.0 years of existence.",
