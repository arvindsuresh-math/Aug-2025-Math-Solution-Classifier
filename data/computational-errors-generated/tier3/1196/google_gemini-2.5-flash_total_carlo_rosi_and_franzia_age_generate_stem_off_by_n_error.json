  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the Franzia wine brand is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi, then the Carlo Rosi is 3*40 = <<3*40=120>>120 years old.\nThe total number of years the Carlo Rosi and the Franzia wine brands have been around is 120+40 = <<120+40=180>>180 years\nThe Carlo Rosi is four times older than the Twin Valley wine brand, meaning the Twin valley wine brand is 40/4 = <<40/4=10.0>>10.0 years old.\nTogether, the three bands have a total of 10.0+180 = <<10.0+180=190.0>>190.0 years of existence.",
