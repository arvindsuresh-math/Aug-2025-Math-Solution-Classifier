  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the weight of food Karen eats every hour: 2 pounds * 1/3 = 2/{food_fraction.denominator} pounds food.\nThen find the total amount of weight Karen's backpack loses per hour she hikes: 2 pounds water/hour + 2/3 pound food/hour = 7/3 pounds/hour.\nMultiply this by the number of hours she hikes to find the total amount of weight she loses: 7/3 pounds/hour * 6 hours = <<7/3*6=14>>14 pounds.\nAdd the weight of all her items to find total starting weight: 20 pounds + 10 pounds + 20 pounds = <<20+10+20=50>>50 pounds.\nThen subtract the weight she loses from the starting weight to find the weight after 6 hours: 50 pounds - 14 pounds = <<50-14=36>>36 pounds",
