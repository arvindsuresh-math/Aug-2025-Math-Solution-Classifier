  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the weight of food Karen eats every hour: 2 pounds * 1/3 = 2/3 pounds food.\nThen find the total amount of weight Karen's backpack loses per hour she hikes: 2 pounds water/hour + 2/3 pound food/hour = 3/8 pounds/hour.\nMultiply this by the number of hours she hikes to find the total amount of weight she loses: 3/8 pounds/hour * 6 hours = <<3/8*6=9/4>>9/4 pounds.\nAdd the weight of all her items to find total starting weight: 20 pounds + 10 pounds + 20 pounds = <<20+10+20=50>>50 pounds.\nThen subtract the weight she loses from the starting weight to find the weight after 6 hours: 50 pounds - 9/4 pounds = <<50-9/4=191/4>>191/4 pounds",
