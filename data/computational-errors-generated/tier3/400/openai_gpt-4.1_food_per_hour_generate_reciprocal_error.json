  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the weight of food Karen eats every hour: 2 pounds * 1/3 = 2/{food_fraction.denominator} pounds food.\nThen find the total amount of weight Karen's backpack loses per hour she hikes: 2 pounds water/hour + 3/2 pound food/hour = 7/2 pounds/hour.\nMultiply this by the number of hours she hikes to find the total amount of weight she loses: 7/2 pounds/hour * 6 hours = <<7/2*6=21>>21 pounds.\nAdd the weight of all her items to find total starting weight: 20 pounds + 10 pounds + 20 pounds = <<20+10+20=50>>50 pounds.\nThen subtract the weight she loses from the starting weight to find the weight after 6 hours: 50 pounds - 21 pounds = <<50-21=29>>29 pounds",
