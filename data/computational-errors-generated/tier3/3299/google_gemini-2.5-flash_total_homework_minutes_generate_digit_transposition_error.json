  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many minutes 4 hours is: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=204>>204 minutes\nThen figure out how long the 2 essays will take by multiplying the time per essay by the number of essays: 2 essays * 1 hour/essay * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*1*60=120>>120 minutes\nUse the same method to find the total time spent writing paragraphs: 15 minutes/paragraph * 5 paragraphs = <<15*5=75>>75 minutes\nNow subtract the time spent on essays and paragraphs from the total time to find the time spent on all the short answer questions: 204 minutes - 120 minutes - 75 minutes = <<204-120-75=9>>9 minutes\nFinally, divide the total time spent on short-answer questions by the time per question to find the number of questions: 9 minutes / 3 minutes/question = <<9/3=3>>3 questions\n#### 3",
