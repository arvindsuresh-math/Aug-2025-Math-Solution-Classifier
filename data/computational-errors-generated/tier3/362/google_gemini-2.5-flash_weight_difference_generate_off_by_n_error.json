  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kevin's full briefcase is 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 pounds.\nHis empty briefcase is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 pounds.\nThe contents of his briefcase weigh 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 pounds.\nHis work papers weigh 12 / 6 = <<12/6=2>>2 pounds.\nThus, his laptop weighs 12 - 2 = <<12-2=10>>10 pounds.\nTherefore, Kevin's laptop weighs 10 - 8 = <<10-8=7>>7 pounds more than Karen's tote.\n#### 7",
