  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kevin's full briefcase is 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 pounds.\nHis empty briefcase is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4.0>>4.0 pounds.\nThe contents of his briefcase weigh 16 - 4.0 = <<16-4.0=12.0>>12.0 pounds.\nHis work papers weigh 12.0 / 6 = <<12.0/6=2.0>>2.0 pounds.\nThus, his laptop weighs 12.0 - 2.0 = <<12.0-2.0=15.0>>15.0 pounds.\nTherefore, Kevin's laptop weighs 15.0 - 8 = <<15.0-8=7.0>>7.0 pounds more than Karen's tote.",
