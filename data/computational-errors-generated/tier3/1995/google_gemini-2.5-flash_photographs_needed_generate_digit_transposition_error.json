  "flawed_nl_solution": "If you took 100 photographs of the project 18 hours ago, and today 20% few photographs have been taken, then 20/100*100 = <<20/100*100=20.0>>20.0 fewer photographs of the project have been taken today.\nThe total number of photographs of the project that have been taken today is 100-20.0 = <<100-20.0=80.0>>80.0\nSo far, you've taken 80.0+100 = <<80.0+100=180.0>>180.0 photographs of the project.\nSince the target number of photographs is 300, the number of photographs that you need to take to reach the target is 300-180.0 = <<300-180.0=210.0>>210.0",
