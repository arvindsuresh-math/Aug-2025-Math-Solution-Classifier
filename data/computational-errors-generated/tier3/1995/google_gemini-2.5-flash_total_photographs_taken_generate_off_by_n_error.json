  "flawed_nl_solution": "If you took 100 photographs of the project 18 hours ago, and today 20% few photographs have been taken, then 20/100*100 = <<20/100*100=20>>20 fewer photographs of the project have been taken today.\nThe total number of photographs of the project that have been taken today is 100-20 = <<100-20=80>>80\nSo far, you've taken 80+100 = <<80+100=175>>175 photographs of the project.\nSince the target number of photographs is 300, the number of photographs that you need to take to reach the target is 300-175 = <<300-175=125>>125\n#### 125",
