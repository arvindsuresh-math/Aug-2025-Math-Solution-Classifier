  "flawed_nl_solution": "If you took 100 photographs of the project 18 hours ago, and today 20% few photographs have been taken, then 20/100*100 = <<20/100*100=20>>20 fewer photographs of the project have been taken today.\nThe total number of photographs of the project that have been taken today is 100-20 = <<100-20=78>>78\nSo far, you've taken 78+100 = <<78+100=178>>178 photographs of the project.\nSince the target number of photographs is 300, the number of photographs that you need to take to reach the target is 300-178 = <<300-178=122>>122\n#### 122",
