  "flawed_nl_solution": "If you took 100 photographs of the project 18 hours ago, and today 20% few photographs have been taken, then 20/100*100 = <<20/100*100=20>>20 fewer photographs of the project have been taken today.\nThe total number of photographs of the project that have been taken today is 100-20 = <<100-20=77>>77\nSo far, you've taken 77+100 = <<77+100=177>>177 photographs of the project.\nSince the target number of photographs is 300, the number of photographs that you need to take to reach the target is 300-177 = <<300-177=123>>123\n#### 123",
