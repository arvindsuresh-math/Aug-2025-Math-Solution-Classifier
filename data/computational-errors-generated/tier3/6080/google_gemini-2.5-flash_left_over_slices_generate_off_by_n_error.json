  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each pizza is 12 slices. Bob at 12 slices / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 slices.\nTom ate one third, or 12 slices / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 slices.\nSally ate one sixth, or 12 slices / 6 = <<12/6=2>>2 slices.\nJerry ate one quarter, or 12 slices / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 slices.\nIn total, they ate 6 slices + 4 slices + 2 slices + 3 slices = <<6+4+2+3=15>>15 slices.\nSo they were left with 12 slices per pizza * 2 pizzas - 15 slices = 12*2 slices - 15 slices = <<12*2-15=10>>10 slices.\n#### 10",
