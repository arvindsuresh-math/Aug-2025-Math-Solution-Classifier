  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ben's spending for the kitchen is $1496 x 1/22 = $<<1496*1/22=68>>68.\nBen's spending for holidays is $1496 x 1/4 = $<<1496*1/4=374>>374.\nBen's spending for children's gifts is $1496 x 1/8 = $<<1496*1/8=11968>>11968.\nThe total amount spent is $68 + $374 + $11968 = $<<68+374+11968=12410>>12410.\nSo, Ben still has $1496 - $12410 = $<<1496-12410=-10914>>-10914 left.",
