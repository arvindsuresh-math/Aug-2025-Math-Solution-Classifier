  "flawed_nl_solution": "1/6 * 240 students = <<1/6*240=40>>40 students. So 40 students read three or more novels.\n7/20 * 240 students = <<7/20*240=84>>84 students. So 84 students read two novels.\n5/12 * 240 students = <<5/12*240=100>>100 students. So 100 students read a novel.\n240 students - (40 students + 84 students + 100 students) = 240 students - 224 students = <<240-(40+84+100)=15>>15 students. So 15 students don't read novels.",
