  "flawed_nl_solution": "1/6 * 240 students = <<1/6*240=40>>40 students. So 40 students read three or more novels.\n7/20 * 240 students = <<7/20*240=48>>48 students. So 48 students read two novels.\n5/12 * 240 students = <<5/12*240=100>>100 students. So 100 students read a novel.\n240 students - (40 students + 48 students + 100 students) = 240 students - 188 students = <<240-(40+48+100)=52>>52 students. So 52 students don't read novels.",
