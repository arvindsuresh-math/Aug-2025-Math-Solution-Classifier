  "flawed_nl_solution": "1/6 * 240 students = <<1/6*240=40>>40 students. So 40 students read three or more novels.\n7/20 * 240 students = <<7/20*240=84>>84 students. So 84 students read two novels.\n5/12 * 240 students = <<5/12*240=10>>10 students. So 10 students read a novel.\n240 students - (40 students + 84 students + 10 students) = 240 students - 134 students = <<240-(40+84+10)=106>>106 students. So 106 students don't read novels.",
