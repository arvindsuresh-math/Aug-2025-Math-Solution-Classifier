  "flawed_nl_solution": "1/6 * 240 students = <<1/6*240=1440>>1440 students. So 1440 students read three or more novels.\n7/20 * 240 students = <<7/20*240=84>>84 students. So 84 students read two novels.\n5/12 * 240 students = <<5/12*240=100>>100 students. So 100 students read a novel.\n240 students - (1440 students + 84 students + 100 students) = 240 students - 1624 students = <<240-(1440+84+100)=-1384>>-1384 students. So -1384 students don't read novels.",
