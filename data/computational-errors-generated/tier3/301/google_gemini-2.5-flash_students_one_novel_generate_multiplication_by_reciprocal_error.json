  "flawed_nl_solution": "1/6 * 240 students = <<1/6*240=40>>40 students. So 40 students read three or more novels.\n35/100 * 240 students = <<35/100*240=84>>84 students. So 84 students read two novels.\n5/12 * 240 students = <<5/12*240=2880/5>>2880/5 students. So 2880/5 students read a novel.\n240 students - (40 students + 84 students + 2880/5 students) = 240 students - 700 students = <<240-(40+84+2880/5)=-460>>-460 students. So -460 students don't read novels.",
