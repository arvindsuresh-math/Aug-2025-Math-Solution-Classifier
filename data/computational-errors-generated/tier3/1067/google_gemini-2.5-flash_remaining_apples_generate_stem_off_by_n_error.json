  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of apples delivered was: 180 apples x 12 crates = <<180*12=2160>>2160 apples\nSo, the number of remaining apples after throwing away the rotten ones was: 2160 apples - 160 apples = <<2160-160=2020>>2020 apples\nAnd now, we can find the total number of boxes of apples by dividing the remaining number of apples by the number of apples per box: 2020 apples / 20 apples/box = <<2020/20=101>>101 boxes of apples.\n#### 101",
