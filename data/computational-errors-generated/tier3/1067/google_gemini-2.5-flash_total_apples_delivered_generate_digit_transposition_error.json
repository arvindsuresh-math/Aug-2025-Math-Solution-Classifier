  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of apples delivered was: 180 apples x 12 crates = <<180*12=1260>>1260 apples\nSo, the number of remaining apples after throwing away the rotten ones was: 1260 apples - 160 apples = <<1260-160=1100>>1100 apples\nAnd now, we can find the total number of boxes of apples by dividing the remaining number of apples by the number of apples per box: 1100 apples / 20 apples/box = <<1100/20=55.0>>55.0 boxes of apples.",
