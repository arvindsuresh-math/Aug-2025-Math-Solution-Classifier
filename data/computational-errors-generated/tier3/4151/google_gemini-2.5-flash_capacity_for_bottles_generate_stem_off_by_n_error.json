  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the weight of 20 cans is 20 cans * 2 oz per can = <<20*2=40>>40 oz.\nThus, Jenny has the capacity to carry 100 oz - 40 oz = <<100-40=30>>30 oz of bottles.\nJenny can carry 30 oz / 6 oz per bottle = <<30/6=5>>5 bottles.\nJenny earns 5 bottles * 10 cents per bottle = <<5*10=50>>50 cents for the bottles.\nJenny earns 20 cans * 3 cents per can = <<20*3=60>>60 cents for the cans.\nIn total, she earns 50 cents + 60 cents = <<50+60=110>>110 cents.\n#### 110",
