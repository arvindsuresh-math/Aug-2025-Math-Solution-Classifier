  "flawed_nl_solution": "For half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 1 candle each. Since half of the cupcakes is 24/2 and she plans to use 1 candle each for this half of the cupcakes, Stephanie needs (24/2)*1 = <<24/2*1=12.0>>12.0 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nFor the other half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 2 candles. Therefore, she will need (24/2)*2 =<<24/2*2=24.0>>24.0 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nBecause Stephanie needs 12.0 candles for half of the cupcakes and 24.0 candles for the other half, she needs a total of 12.0+24.0=<<12.0+24.0=37.0>>37.0 candles.\nSince Stephanie needs 37.0 candles to decorate all the cupcakes and she currently has 30 candles, Stephanie needs 37.0-30= <<37.0-30=7.0>>7.0 additional candles.",
