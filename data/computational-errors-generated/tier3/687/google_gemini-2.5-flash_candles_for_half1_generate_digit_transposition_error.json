  "flawed_nl_solution": "For half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 1 candle each. Since half of the cupcakes is 24/2 and she plans to use 1 candle each for this half of the cupcakes, Stephanie needs (24/2)*1 = <<24/2*1=21>>21 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nFor the other half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 2 candles. Therefore, she will need (24/2)*2 =<<24/2*2=24>>24 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nBecause Stephanie needs 21 candles for half of the cupcakes and 24 candles for the other half, she needs a total of 21+24=<<21+24=45>>45 candles.\nSince Stephanie needs 45 candles to decorate all the cupcakes and she currently has 30 candles, Stephanie needs 45-30= <<45-30=15>>15 additional candles.",
