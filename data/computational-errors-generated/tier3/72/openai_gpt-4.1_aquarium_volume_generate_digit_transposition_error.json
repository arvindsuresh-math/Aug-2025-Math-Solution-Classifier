  "flawed_nl_solution": "First calculate the volume of the aquarium by multiplying its length, width and height: 4 ft * 6 ft * 3 ft = <<4*6*3=27>>27 cubic ft\nThen figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after the cat knocks it over: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\nThen figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after Nancy refills it: 3 * 1/4 = 3/4\nNow multiply the proportion of the aquarium that's full by the aquarium's volume to find out how much water is in it: 27 cubic ft * 3/4 = <<27*3/4=81/4>>81/4 cubic ft",
