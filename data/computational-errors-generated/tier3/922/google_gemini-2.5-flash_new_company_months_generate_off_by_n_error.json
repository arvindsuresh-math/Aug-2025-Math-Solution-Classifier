  "flawed_nl_solution": "In her old company, if she worked for three years, the total number of months she was paid for is 3 years*12, which is the number of months in a year = <<3*12=36>>36 months.\nIf each month she was paid $5000, her total earnings in the old company were $5000* 36 = $<<5000*36=180000>>180000\nIn her new company, she is paid 20% more, which is 20/100*$5000 = $<<20/100*5000=1000>>1000 per month more than what she was paid at the old company.\nIn total, she earns $5000+$1000 = $<<5000+1000=6000>>6000 per month in her new company.\nSince she's worked 5 months more in the new company than the old company, she has worked for 36+5 = <<36+5=45>>45 months in the new company.\nThe total amount she's earned in the new company is $6000*45 = $<<6000*45=270000>>270000\nThe combined total for both companies is $270000+$180000 = $<<270000+180000=450000>>450000",
