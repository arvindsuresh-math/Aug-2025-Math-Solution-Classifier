  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=3260>>3260.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $3260 = $<<1250+3260=4510>>4510.\nAnd, he saved $4510 x 20/100 = $<<4510*20/100=902>>902.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $4510 - $902= $<<4510-902=3608>>3608\n#### 3608",
