  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=3260.0>>3260.0.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $3260.0 = $<<1250+3260.0=4510.0>>4510.0.\nAnd, he saved $4510.0 x 20/100 = $<<4510.0*20/100=902.0>>902.0.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $4510.0 - $902.0= $<<4510.0-902.0=3608.0>>3608.0",
