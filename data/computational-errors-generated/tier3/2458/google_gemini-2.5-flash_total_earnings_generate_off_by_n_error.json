  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=2360>>2360.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $2360 = $<<1250+2360=3615>>3615.\nAnd, he saved $3615 x 20/100 = $<<3615*20/100=723>>723.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $3615 - $723= $<<3615-723=2892>>2892\n#### 2892",
