  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=2360.0>>2360.0.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $2360.0 = $<<1250+2360.0=3605.0>>3605.0.\nAnd, he saved $3605.0 x 20/100 = $<<3605.0*20/100=721.0>>721.0.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $3605.0 - $721.0= $<<3605.0-721.0=2884.0>>2884.0",
