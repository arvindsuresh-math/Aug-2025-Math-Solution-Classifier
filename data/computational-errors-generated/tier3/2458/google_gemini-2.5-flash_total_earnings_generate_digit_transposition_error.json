  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=2360.0>>2360.0.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $2360.0 = $<<1250+2360.0=6310.0>>6310.0.\nAnd, he saved $6310.0 x 20/100 = $<<6310.0*20/100=1262.0>>1262.0.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $6310.0 - $1262.0= $<<6310.0-1262.0=5048.0>>5048.0",
