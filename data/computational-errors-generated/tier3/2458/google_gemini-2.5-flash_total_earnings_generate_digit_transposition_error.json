  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=2360>>2360.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $2360 = $<<1250+2360=3160>>3160.\nAnd, he saved $3160 x 20/100 = $<<3160*20/100=632>>632.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $3160 - $632= $<<3160-632=2528>>2528",
