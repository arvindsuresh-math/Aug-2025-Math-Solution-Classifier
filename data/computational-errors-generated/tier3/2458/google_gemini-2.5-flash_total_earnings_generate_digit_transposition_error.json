  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=2360>>2360.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $2360 = $<<1250+2360=6310>>6310.\nAnd, he saved $6310 x 20/100 = $<<6310*20/100=1262>>1262.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $6310 - $1262= $<<6310-1262=5048>>5048\n#### 5048",
