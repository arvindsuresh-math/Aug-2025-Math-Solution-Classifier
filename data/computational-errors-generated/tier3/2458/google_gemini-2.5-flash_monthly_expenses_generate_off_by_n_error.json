  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=2360>>2360.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $2360 = $<<1250+2360=3610>>3610.\nAnd, he saved $3610 x 20/100 = $<<3610*20/100=722>>722.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $3610 - $722= $<<3610-722=2886>>2886",
