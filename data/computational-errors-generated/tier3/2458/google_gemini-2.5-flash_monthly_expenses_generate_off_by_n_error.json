  "flawed_nl_solution": "Robert earned a commission of $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=2360.0>>2360.0.\nSo, he earned a total of $1250 + $2360.0 = $<<1250+2360.0=3610.0>>3610.0.\nAnd, he saved $3610.0 x 20/100 = $<<3610.0*20/100=722.0>>722.0.\nTherefore, his total expenses last month was $3610.0 - $722.0= $<<3610.0-722.0=2891.0>>2891.0",
