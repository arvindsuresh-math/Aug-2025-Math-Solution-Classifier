  "flawed_nl_solution": "Porter's weekly earning is $8x5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nPorter's monthly earning is $40x4= $<<40*4=610>>610.\nThe extra amount he will earn when he works on his overtime is $8 x 50/100 = $<<8*50/100=4>>4.\nSo the amount he will earn on his overtime is $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12.\nSince he will render overtime once every week, the total overtime pay he will earn in a month is $12 x 4 = $<<12*4=48>>48.\nTherefore the total money he will earn in a week is $610+$48 = $<<610+48=658>>658.\n#### 658",
