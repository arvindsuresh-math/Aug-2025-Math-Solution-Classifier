  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of books borrowed on Friday is higher by 40 * 2/5 = <<40*2/5=61>>61 books.\nThere are 5 days from Monday to Friday inclusive, so Krystian borrows an average of 5 * 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 books during that time.\nWith Friday's increase in borrowings, during one week Krystian borrows 200 + 61 = <<200+61=261>>261 books.",
