  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of books borrowed on Friday is higher by 40 * 40/100 = <<40*40/100=16>>16 books.\nThere are 5 days from Monday to Friday inclusive, so Krystian borrows an average of 5 * 40 = <<5*40=2000>>2000 books during that time.\nWith Friday's increase in borrowings, during one week Krystian borrows 2000 + 16 = <<2000+16=2016>>2016 books.",
