  "flawed_nl_solution": "The garden is 220 * 120 = <<220*120=264000>>264000 square feet.\nThe tilled land will take up half the area, and the trellises and raised beds will be the other half. Each half is 264000 / 2 = <<264000/2=132000>>132000 square feet.\nThe trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.\nSo the total area of the raised bed area will be 132000 square feet * (2/3) = <<132000*(2/3)=88000>>88000 square feet.\n#### 88000",
