  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we must recognize that all pairs of shoes and socks are actually 2 items each, whereas the pants and the t-shirts are individual items. Therefore there are 20*2= <<20*2=40>>40 individual socks in 20 pairs of socks.\nSimilarly, there are 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 individual shoes in 5 pairs of shoes.\nTherefore, Jonas has 40+10+10+10= <<40+10+10+10=60>>60 individual items in his collection.\nTo double this number, we perform 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120.\nThis means we need 120-60=<<120-60=60>>60 new items to double the size.\nSince there are 2 individual socks in each pair, we take 60/2= <<60/2=30.0>>30.0 new pairs of socks.",
