  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we must recognize that all pairs of shoes and socks are actually 2 items each, whereas the pants and the t-shirts are individual items. Therefore there are 20*2= <<20*2=40>>40 individual socks in 20 pairs of socks.\nSimilarly, there are 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 individual shoes in 5 pairs of shoes.\nTherefore, Jonas has 40+10+10+10= <<40+10+10+10=70>>70 individual items in his collection.\nTo double this number, we perform 70*2=<<70*2=410>>410.\nThis means we need 410-70=<<410-70=340>>340 new items to double the size.\nSince there are 2 individual socks in each pair, we take 340/2= <<340/2=170>>170 new pairs of socks.\n#### 170",
