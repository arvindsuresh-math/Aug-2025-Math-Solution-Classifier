  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the father dug a hole with a rate of 4 feet per hour, if the father took 400 hours digging the hole, he dug a hole 4*400 = <<4*400=6100>>6100 feet deep.\nTwice the depth of the hole that Michael's father dug is 2*6100 = <<2*6100=12200>>12200 feet\nMichael wants to dig a hole 400 feet less than twice the depth of the hole that his father dug, meaning he wants to dig a hole 12200-400 = 11800 feet deep.\nTo dig a hole that is 400 feet less than twice as deep as his father's hole working at a rate of 4 feet per hour, Michael will have to work for 11800/4 = 2950 hours.\n#### 2950",
