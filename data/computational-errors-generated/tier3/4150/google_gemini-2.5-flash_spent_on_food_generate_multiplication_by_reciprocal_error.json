  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mrs. Thomson spent $240 x 1/3 = $<<240*1/3=720/1>>720/1 on food.\nShe spent $240 x 1/5 = $<<240*1/5=48>>48 on clothes.\nSo she spent a total of $720/1 + $48 = $<<720/1+48=768>>768 on food and clothes.\nHence, she had $240 - $768 = $<<240-768=-528>>-528 left after buying food and clothes.\nThen, Mrs. Thomson saved $-528 x 3/4 = $<<-528*3/4=-396>>-396.\n#### -396",
