  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mrs. Thomson spent $240 x 1/3 = $<<240*1/3=80>>80 on food.\nShe spent $240 x 1/5 = $<<240*1/5=1200/1>>1200/1 on clothes.\nSo she spent a total of $80 + $1200/1 = $<<80+1200/1=1280>>1280 on food and clothes.\nHence, she had $240 - $1280 = $<<240-1280=-1040>>-1040 left after buying food and clothes.\nThen, Mrs. Thomson saved $-1040 x 3/4 = $<<-1040*3/4=-780>>-780.\n#### -780",
