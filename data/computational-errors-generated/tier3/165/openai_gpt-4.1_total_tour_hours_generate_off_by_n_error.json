  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bus traveled 55 + 10 = <<55+10=65>>65 miles going back to the starting point.\nSo, the bus traveled a total of 55 + 65 = <<55+65=120>>120 miles.\nIt took 120 x 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 minutes to travel.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then the bus traveled for 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours.\nTherefore, the entire tour took 4 + 2 = <<4+2=8>>8 hours.\n#### 8",
