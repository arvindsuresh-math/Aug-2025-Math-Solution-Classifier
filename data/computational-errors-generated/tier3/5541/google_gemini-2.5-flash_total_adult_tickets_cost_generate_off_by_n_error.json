  "flawed_nl_solution": "First take out the cost of the concessions. That leaves $76 - $12 = $<<76-12=64>>64 for the movie tickets\nEach child ticket costs $7, so two children's tickets cost $7 per child ticket * 2 child tickets = $<<7*2=14>>14\nTo find the amount spent on adult tickets, subtract the cost of the children's tickets to get $64 - $14 = $<<64-14=55>>55 for adult tickets.\nDivide $55 for adult tickets / 5 adults = $<<55/5=11>>11 per adult ticket.\n#### 11",
