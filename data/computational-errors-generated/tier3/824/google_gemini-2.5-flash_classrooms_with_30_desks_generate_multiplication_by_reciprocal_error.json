  "flawed_nl_solution": "One-third of the classrooms have 30 desks, so there are 1/3 * 15 = <<1/3*15=45/1>>45/1 classrooms like that.\nThe rest, which means 15 - 45/1 = <<15-45/1=-30>>-30 classrooms, have 25 desks.\nOne-third of the classrooms can fit 45/1 * 30 = <<45/1*30=1350>>1350 students.\nThe rest can fit -30 * 25 = <<-30*25=-750>>-750 students.\nSo in total, the school can be filled with 1350 + -750 = <<1350+-750=600>>600 students.\n#### 600",
