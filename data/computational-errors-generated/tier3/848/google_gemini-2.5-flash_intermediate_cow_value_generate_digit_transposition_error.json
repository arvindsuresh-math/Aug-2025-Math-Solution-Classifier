  "flawed_nl_solution": "Per week, one cow produces 108 liters / 6 cows = <<108/6=18.0>>18.0 liters/cow.\nThe cows produced 2160 liters of milk over 5 weeks. So we have 2160 liters / 18.0 liters/cow = <<2160/18.0=210.0>>210.0 cows.\nFurther, we have to divide 210.0 cows / 5 weeks = <<210.0/5=42.0>>42.0 cows.",
