  "flawed_nl_solution": "The amount that the couple would cover for the hospital bill is $128/2 = $<<128/2=64>>64.\nThe couple's total expenses (salary and hospital bill) is $160 + $64 = $<<160+64=226>>226.\nSo each of them should give $226/2 = $<<226/2=113>>113 in total.\nSince the husband paid the entire half of the hospital bill already ($64), he still needs to pay $113 - $64 = $<<113-64=49>>49.\n#### 49",
