  "flawed_nl_solution": "They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4.0>>4.0 gallons of paint for their walls.\nSince they will do a second coating, then they would need 4.0 gallons x 2 = <<4.0*2=8.0>>8.0 gallons in all.\nEight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8.0 gallons = $<<45*8.0=630.0>>630.0.\nThus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $630.0/2 = $<<630.0/2=315.0>>315.0.",
