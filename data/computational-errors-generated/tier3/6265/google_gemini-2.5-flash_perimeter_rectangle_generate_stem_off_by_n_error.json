  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the rectangular patch of land measures 400 feet by 300 feet, the total length around it or its perimeter is given by 2 * 400 + 2 * 300 = 800 + 600 = <<2*400+2*300=1430>>1430\nThe square patch's perimeter is double that length, so it's 1430 * 2 = <<1430*2=2860>>2860\nSince the square has four equal sides, one side of the square patch of land will have a length of 2860/4 = <<2860/4=715>>715 feet\n#### 715",
