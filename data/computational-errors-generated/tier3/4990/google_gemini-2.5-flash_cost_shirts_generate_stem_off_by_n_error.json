  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of laundering all of Leo's trousers is 10 * 9 = <<10*9=90>>90 dollars\nSince the total bill was 140 dollars, this means that all the shirts were cleaned for 140 - 90 = <<140-90=40>>40 dollars.\nAs each shirt is cleaned at 5 dollars, Sudsy Laundry therefore laundered a total of 40/5 = <<40/5=8>>8 shirts\nThe missing shirts are therefore 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 shirts\n#### 6",
