  "flawed_nl_solution": "If each movie ticket is sold at $30, the cost of buying eight movie tickets is 8*$30 = $240<<8*30=240>>240\nSince eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of buying one football game ticket is $240/2 = $210<<240/2=210>>210\nBuying 5 football game tickets will cost 5*$210 = $1050<<5*210=1050>>1050\nThe total cost of buying eight movie tickets and five football game tickets is $1050+$240 = $1290\n#### 1290",
