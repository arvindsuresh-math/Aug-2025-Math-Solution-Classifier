  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and 2 cups are recommended per day, bringing the total to 7 days * 2 cups/day =<<7*2=14>>14 cups for the week.\nOut of the 14 total cups needed for the week, Sarah has already eaten 8, for a total of 14 cups - 8 cups = <<14-8=8>>8 cups left to consume for the week.\nSunday through Thursday equals 5 days that have passed. If there are 7 days in the week then Sarah has 7 days - 5 days = <<7-5=2>>2 days left of the week.\nIf she needs to eat 8 more cups in the next 2 days then she will have to eat 8 cups / 2 days = <<8/2=4>>4 cups per day over the next two days.\n#### 4",
