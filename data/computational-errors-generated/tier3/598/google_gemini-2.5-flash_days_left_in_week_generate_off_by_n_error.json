  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 7 days in a week and 2 cups are recommended per day, bringing the total to 7 days * 2 cups/day =<<7*2=14>>14 cups for the week.\nOut of the 14 total cups needed for the week, Sarah has already eaten 8, for a total of 14 cups - 8 cups = <<14-8=6>>6 cups left to consume for the week.\nSunday through Thursday equals 5 days that have passed. If there are 7 days in the week then Sarah has 7 days - 5 days = <<7-5=6>>6 days left of the week.\nIf she needs to eat 6 more cups in the next 6 days then she will have to eat 6 cups / 6 days = <<6/6=1.0>>1.0 cups per day over the next two days.",
