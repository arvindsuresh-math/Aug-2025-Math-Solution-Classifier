  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 10 people shovel 10000 pounds per 10 days, or 10000/10=<<10000/10=1000>>1000 pounds per day per 10 people.\nAnd 1000 pounds per day per 10 people is 1000/10=<<1000/10=1000>>1000 pounds per day per person.\nHalf of ten people is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 people.\nAt 1000 pounds per day per person, 5 people can shovel 5*1000=<<5*1000=5000>>5000 pounds per day.\nTherefore, for 5 people to shovel 40000 pounds, it will take 40000/5000=<<40000/5000=8>>8 days.\n#### 8",
