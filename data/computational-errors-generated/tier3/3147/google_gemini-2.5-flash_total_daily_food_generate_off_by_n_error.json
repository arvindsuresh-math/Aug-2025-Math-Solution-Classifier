  "flawed_nl_solution": "His parakeets eat 6 grams a day, because 3 parakeets times 2 grams each equals 6 grams.\nHis parrots will eat 28 grams a day because 2 parrots times 14 grams equals <<2*14=28>>28 grams.\nEach finch will eat 1 gram a day, because they eat half of what a parakeet does and 1/2 of 2 equals 1.\nHis finches will eat 4 grams a day because 4 finches times 1 gram equals 4 grams.\nHis birds eat 43 grams a day because 6 plus 28 plus 4 equals <<6+28+4=43>>43\nEach week has 7 days\nTherefore, in a week he will need 301 grams because 7 times 43 equals <<7*43=301>>301.\n#### 301",
