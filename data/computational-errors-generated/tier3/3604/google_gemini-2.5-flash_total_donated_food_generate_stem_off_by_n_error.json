  "flawed_nl_solution": "If 40 pounds of food was donated to the food bank in the first week, the second week, which had twice the amount of food donated as the first week, had 2*40 = 80 pounds of food.\nThe total amount of food donated to the food bank after the second week is 40+80 = <<40+80=110>>110 pounds.\nIn the third week, she gave to the homeless 70/100*110 = <<70/100*110=77>>77 pounds of food.\nThe total amount of food remaining in the food bank after she gave out 70% to the homeless is 110-77 = <<110-77=33>>33 pounds of food.\n#### 33",
