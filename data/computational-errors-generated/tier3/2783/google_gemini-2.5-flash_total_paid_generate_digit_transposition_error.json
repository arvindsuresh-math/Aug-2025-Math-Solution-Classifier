  "flawed_nl_solution": "The two sets of plates amount to $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nSo the table and the two sets of plates amount to $50 + $40 = $<<50+40=90>>90 in all.\nSince Jude received a $4 change, then he paid a total of $130 - $4 = $<<130-4=216>>216 for the chairs, tables, and plates.\nThus, the three chairs cost $216 - $90 = $<<216-90=126>>126.\nTherefore, each chair cost $126/3 = $<<126/3=42>>42.\n#### 42",
