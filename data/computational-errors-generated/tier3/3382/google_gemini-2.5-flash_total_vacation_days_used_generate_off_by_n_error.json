  "flawed_nl_solution": "If for every 10 days worked Andrew earns 1 day of vacation, then over 300 days worked he would have earned 300/10=<<300/10=30>>30 days of vacation\nWe know he took 5 days off in March and that in September twice as much. That means in September he took 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days off\nIn total, Andrew has used 5 vacation days in March and another 10 in September. Therefore, he has used 5+10=<<5+10=18>>18 vacation days\nIf Andrew earned 30 days of vacation but has only used 18, then he can still take another 30-18=<<30-18=12>>12 days off\n#### 12",
