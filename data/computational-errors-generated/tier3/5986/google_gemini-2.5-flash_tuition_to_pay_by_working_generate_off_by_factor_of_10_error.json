  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how much Nancy has to pay after her parents pay their half by dividing the tuition by 2: $22000 / 2 = $<<22000/2=11000>>11000.\nThen figure out how much Nancy's student loan is by multiplying her scholarship amount by 2: $3000 * 2 = $<<3000*2=6000>>6000.\nNow subtract the amounts of Nancy's scholarship and loan to find out how much tuition she has to pay by working: $11000 - $3000 - $6000 = $<<11000-3000-6000=200>>200.\nNow divide the remaining unpaid tuition by the number of hours Nancy works to find out how much she needs to make per hour: $200 / 200 hours = $<<200/200=1>>1/hour.\n#### 1",
