  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how much Nancy has to pay after her parents pay their half by dividing the tuition by 2: $22000 / 2 = $<<22000/2=11000>>11000.\nThen figure out how much Nancy's student loan is by multiplying her scholarship amount by 2: $3000 * 2 = $<<3000*2=600>>600.\nNow subtract the amounts of Nancy's scholarship and loan to find out how much tuition she has to pay by working: $11000 - $3000 - $600 = $<<11000-3000-600=7400>>7400.\nNow divide the remaining unpaid tuition by the number of hours Nancy works to find out how much she needs to make per hour: $7400 / 200 hours = $<<7400/200=37>>37/hour.\n#### 37",
