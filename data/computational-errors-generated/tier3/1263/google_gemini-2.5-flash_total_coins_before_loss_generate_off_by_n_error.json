  "flawed_nl_solution": "Phil started with 50, and doubled this amount the next year for 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 coins\nPhil then collected 3 per month the following year, and since there are 12 months in a year that was 3*12=<<3*12=36>>36 coins added\nPhil then collected 1 every third month, and since there are 12 months that means he collected one every 12/3=4 months, for 4 coins added\nBefore he lost a quarter of his coins, Phil had 100+36+4 coins, or <<100+36+4=144>>144 coins in total.\nLosing a quarter of 144 coins means Phill lost 144/4=<<144/4=36>>36 coins\nThat means Phil had 144-36= <<144-36=108>>108 coins remaining\n#### 108",
