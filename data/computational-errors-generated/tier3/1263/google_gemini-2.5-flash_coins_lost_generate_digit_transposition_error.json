  "flawed_nl_solution": "Phil started with 50, and doubled this amount the next year for 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 coins\nPhil then collected 3 per month the following year, and since there are 12 months in a year that was 3*12=<<3*12=36>>36 coins added\nPhil then collected 1 every third month, and since there are 12 months that means he collected one every 12/3=4 months, for 4 coins added\nBefore he lost a quarter of his coins, Phil had 100+36+4 coins, or <<100+36+4=140>>140 coins in total.\nLosing a quarter of 140 coins means Phill lost 140/4=<<140/4=53>>53 coins\nThat means Phil had 140-53= <<140-53=87>>87 coins remaining",
