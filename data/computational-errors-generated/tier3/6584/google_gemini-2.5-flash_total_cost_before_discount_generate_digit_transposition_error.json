  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total cost of the four T-shirts is 4 x $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThree pairs of pants cost 3 x $80 = $<<3*80=240>>240.\nTwo pairs of shoes cost 2 x $150 = $<<2*150=300>>300.\nThe total amount of all the items is $80 + $240 + $300 = $<<80+240+300=260>>260.\nThus, Eugene will get a discount of 10/100 x $260 = $26. Therefore, Eugene will have to pay $260 - $26 = $<<260-26=234>>234.\n#### 234",
