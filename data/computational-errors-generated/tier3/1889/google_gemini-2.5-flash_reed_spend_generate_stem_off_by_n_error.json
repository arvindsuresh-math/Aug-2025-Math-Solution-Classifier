  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Trevor spends $20 more than Reed every year to buy toys, Reed spends $80-$20 = $80.\nSince Reed uses $80 every year to buy toys, his friend Quinn uses 80/2 = $<<80/2=40>>40 every year to buy toys.\nThe total amount of money the three spend in a year together to buy toys is $40+$80+$80 = $<<40+80+80=200>>200.\nThe total amount of money the three will use to buy toys in 4 years is $200*4 = $<<200*4=800>>800.\n#### 800",
