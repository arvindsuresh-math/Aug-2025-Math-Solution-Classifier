  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Trevor spends $20 more than Reed every year to buy toys, Reed spends $80-$20 = $50.\nSince Reed uses $50 every year to buy toys, his friend Quinn uses 50/2 = $<<50/2=25>>25 every year to buy toys.\nThe total amount of money the three spend in a year together to buy toys is $25+$50+$80 = $<<25+50+80=155>>155.\nThe total amount of money the three will use to buy toys in 4 years is $155*4 = $<<155*4=620>>620.\n#### 620",
