  "flawed_nl_solution": "Christina's age will be half of 80 in five years to come, meaning in five years, Christina's age will be 1/2*80=160/1 years.\nIf in five years Christina will be 160/1, currently she is 160/1-5=<<160/1-5=155>>155 years old.\nOscar will be 3/5 times as old as Christina is now in 15 years, meaning he will be 3/5*155=<<3/5*155=93>>93 years old in 15 years.\nCurrently, Oscar is 93-15=<<93-15=78>>78 years old.\n#### 78",
