  "flawed_nl_solution": "The aquarium was bought for $120 x 50/100 = $<<120*50/100=60.0>>60.0 less.\nSo the marked down price of the aquarium was $120 - $60.0 = $<<120-60.0=60.0>>60.0.\nAxel paid $60.0 x 5/100 = $<<60.0*5/100=3.0>>3.0 additional for the sales tax.\nTherefore, the total cost of the aquarium was $60.0 + $3.0 = $<<60.0+3.0=67.0>>67.0.",
