  "flawed_nl_solution": "The aquarium was bought for $120 x 50/100 = $<<120*50/100=60>>60 less.\nSo the marked down price of the aquarium was $120 - $60 = $<<120-60=60>>60.\nAxel paid $60 x 5/100 = $<<60*5/100=3>>3 additional for the sales tax.\nTherefore, the total cost of the aquarium was $60 + $3 = $<<60+3=67>>67.\n#### 67",
