  "flawed_nl_solution": "Susie earned $10 x 3 = $<<10*3=30>>30 per day.\nLast week, she earned a total of $30 x 7 = $<<30*7=201>>201.\nShe spent $201 x 3/10 = $<<201*3/10=603/10>>603/10 on make-up.\nWhile she spent $201 x 2/5 = $<<201*2/5=402/5>>402/5 on her skincare products.\nThus, she spent a total of $603/10 + $402/5 = $<<603/10+402/5=1407/10>>1407/10 from her earnings.\nTherefore, Susie is left with $201 - $1407/10 = $<<201-1407/10=603/10>>603/10 from her earnings last week.\n#### 603/10",
