  "flawed_nl_solution": "Susie earned $10 x 3 = $<<10*3=30>>30 per day.\nLast week, she earned a total of $30 x 7 = $<<30*7=120>>120.\nShe spent $120 x 3/10 = $<<120*3/10=36>>36 on make-up.\nWhile she spent $120 x 2/5 = $<<120*2/5=48>>48 on her skincare products.\nThus, she spent a total of $36 + $48 = $<<36+48=84>>84 from her earnings.\nTherefore, Susie is left with $120 - $84 = $<<120-84=36>>36 from her earnings last week.\n#### 36",
