  "flawed_nl_solution": "Susie earned $10 x 3 = $<<10*3=30>>30 per day.\nLast week, she earned a total of $30 x 7 = $<<30*7=210>>210.\nShe spent $210 x 3/10 = $<<210*3/10=63>>63 on make-up.\nWhile she spent $210 x 2/5 = $<<210*2/5=1050/2>>1050/2 on her skincare products.\nThus, she spent a total of $63 + $1050/2 = $<<63+1050/2=588>>588 from her earnings.\nTherefore, Susie is left with $210 - $588 = $<<210-588=-378>>-378 from her earnings last week.",
