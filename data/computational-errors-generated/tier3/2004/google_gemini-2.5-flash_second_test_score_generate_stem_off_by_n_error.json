  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the average of marks scored in four tests by Jake was 75, the total marks that he scored in the four tests are 4*75 = <<4*75=300>>300\nIf jake scored 80 marks in the first test and 10 more in the second test, he scored 80+10= <<80+10=80>>80 marks in the second test.\nThe combined marks for the first and the second test is 80+80 = <<80+80=160>>160\nThe total marks Jake scored in the third and fourth test is 300-160= <<300-160=140>>140\nSince Jake scored an equal number of marks in the third and fourth tests, he scored 140/2 =<<140/2=70.0>>70.0 marks in each of the third and fourth tests.",
