  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the average of marks scored in four tests by Jake was 75, the total marks that he scored in the four tests are 4*75 = <<4*75=3000>>3000\nIf jake scored 80 marks in the first test and 10 more in the second test, he scored 80+10= <<80+10=90>>90 marks in the second test.\nThe combined marks for the first and the second test is 90+80 = <<90+80=170>>170\nThe total marks Jake scored in the third and fourth test is 3000-170= <<3000-170=2830>>2830\nSince Jake scored an equal number of marks in the third and fourth tests, he scored 2830/2 =<<2830/2=1415>>1415 marks in each of the third and fourth tests.\n#### 1415",
