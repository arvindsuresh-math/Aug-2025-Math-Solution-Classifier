So his 1 hour and 45 min podcast is 1*60+45 = <<1*60+45=105>>105 minutes long\nSo far he has downloaded 45+90+105+60 = <<45+90+105+60=300>>300 min\nIf he converts 300 min to hours then he has 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of podcasts downloaded\nHe has 5 hours of podcasts and his drive is 6 hours so he will need 6 - 5 = <<6-5=3>>3 more hour of podcasts\n#### 3",
