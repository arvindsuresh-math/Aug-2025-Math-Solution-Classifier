  "flawed_nl_solution": "Cole has to pay 3 * 9 = $<<3*9=72>>72 for one side of the side fence.\nFor the shared left fence, he has to pay two-thirds of 72, so he has to pay 72 * 2 / 3 = $<<72*2/3=48.0>>48.0.\nThe shared back fence will cost 3 * 18 = $<<3*18=54>>54.\nHe has to pay for half the back fence, so it will cost 54 / 2 = $<<54/2=27.0>>27.0.\nThus, Cole has to pay 48.0 + 72 + 27.0 = $<<48.0+72+27.0=147.0>>147.0 for the fence.",
