  "flawed_nl_solution": "Cole has to pay 3 * 9 = $<<3*9=27>>27 for one side of the side fence.\nFor the shared left fence, he has to pay two-thirds of 27, so he has to pay 27 * 2 / 3 = $<<27*2/3=18>>18.\nThe shared back fence will cost 3 * 18 = $<<3*18=54>>54.\nHe has to pay for half the back fence, so it will cost 54 / 2 = $<<54/2=27>>27.\nThus, Cole has to pay 18 + 27 + 27 = $<<18+27+27=71>>71 for the fence.",
