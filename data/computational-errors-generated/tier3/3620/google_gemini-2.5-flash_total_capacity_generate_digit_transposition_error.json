  "flawed_nl_solution": "Given that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1/1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.\nIf 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = <<16/2=8>>8 gallons\nThe total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=42>>42 gallons\n#### 42",
