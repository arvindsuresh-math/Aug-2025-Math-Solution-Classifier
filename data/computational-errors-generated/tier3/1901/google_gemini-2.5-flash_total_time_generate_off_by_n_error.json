  "flawed_nl_solution": "When they covered 1/4 of the total distance, they were 1/4 * 200 = <<1/4*200=50>>50 miles away from the starting point.\nThe total distance remaining is 200 - 50 = <<200-50=150>>150 miles.\nIf they took 1 hour to travel 50 miles, their speed was 50/1 = <<50/1=50>>50 miles per hour.\nIf Roger was driving at 50 miles per hour, then the total time it took him to travel 150 miles is 150/50 = <<150/50=3>>3 hours.\nThe total amount of time taken for the whole journey is 3 + 1 + 1= 6 hours.",
