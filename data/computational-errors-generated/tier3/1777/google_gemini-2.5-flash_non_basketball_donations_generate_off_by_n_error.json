  "flawed_nl_solution": "Some of the pool floats were damaged, which means that 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30.0>>30.0 pool floats were discarded.\nThis left the class with 120 - 30.0 = <<120-30.0=90.0>>90.0 pool floats that were actually part of the donations they need to organize.\nThis means there were a total of 60 basketball hoops + 90.0 pool floats + 50 footballs + 40 tennis balls = <<60+90.0+50+40=245.0>>245.0 donations that were not basketballs.\nSo out of the donations, there were 300 donations - 245.0 = <<300-245.0=55.0>>55.0 basketballs.\nIn addition, half of the basketball hoops were donated with a basketball included which amounts to 60 basketball hoops / 2 = <<60/2=30.0>>30.0 basketballs.\nThere was therefore a total of 55.0 + 30.0 = <<55.0+30.0=85.0>>85.0 basketballs donated.",
