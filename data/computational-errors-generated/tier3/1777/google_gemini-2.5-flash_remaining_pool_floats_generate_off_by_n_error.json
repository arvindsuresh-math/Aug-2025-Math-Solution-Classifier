  "flawed_nl_solution": "Some of the pool floats were damaged, which means that 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 pool floats were discarded.\nThis left the class with 120 - 30 = <<120-30=92>>92 pool floats that were actually part of the donations they need to organize.\nThis means there were a total of 60 basketball hoops + 92 pool floats + 50 footballs + 40 tennis balls = <<60+92+50+40=242>>242 donations that were not basketballs.\nSo out of the donations, there were 300 donations - 242 = <<300-242=58>>58 basketballs.\nIn addition, half of the basketball hoops were donated with a basketball included which amounts to 60 basketball hoops / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 basketballs.\nThere was therefore a total of 58 + 30 = <<58+30=88>>88 basketballs donated.\n#### 88",
