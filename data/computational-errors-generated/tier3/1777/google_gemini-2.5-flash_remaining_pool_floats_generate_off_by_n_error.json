  "flawed_nl_solution": "Some of the pool floats were damaged, which means that 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30.0>>30.0 pool floats were discarded.\nThis left the class with 120 - 30.0 = <<120-30.0=85.0>>85.0 pool floats that were actually part of the donations they need to organize.\nThis means there were a total of 60 basketball hoops + 85.0 pool floats + 50 footballs + 40 tennis balls = <<60+85.0+50+40=235.0>>235.0 donations that were not basketballs.\nSo out of the donations, there were 300 donations - 235.0 = <<300-235.0=65.0>>65.0 basketballs.\nIn addition, half of the basketball hoops were donated with a basketball included which amounts to 60 basketball hoops / 2 = <<60/2=30.0>>30.0 basketballs.\nThere was therefore a total of 65.0 + 30.0 = <<65.0+30.0=95.0>>95.0 basketballs donated.",
