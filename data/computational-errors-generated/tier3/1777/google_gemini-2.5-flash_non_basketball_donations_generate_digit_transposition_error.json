  "flawed_nl_solution": "Some of the pool floats were damaged, which means that 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 pool floats were discarded.\nThis left the class with 120 - 30 = <<120-30=90>>90 pool floats that were actually part of the donations they need to organize.\nThis means there were a total of 60 basketball hoops + 90 pool floats + 50 footballs + 40 tennis balls = <<60+90+50+40=204>>204 donations that were not basketballs.\nSo out of the donations, there were 300 donations - 204 = <<300-204=96>>96 basketballs.\nIn addition, half of the basketball hoops were donated with a basketball included which amounts to 60 basketball hoops / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 basketballs.\nThere was therefore a total of 96 + 30 = <<96+30=126>>126 basketballs donated.\n#### 126",
