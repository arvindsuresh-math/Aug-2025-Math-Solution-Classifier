  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 60/2=<<60/2=30.0>>30.0 since Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt.\nThe total number of eggs that Emma and Tank gathered in the second round was 60+30.0=<<60+30.0=90.0>>90.0\nTank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round, meaning she had gathered 30.0+20=<<30.0+20=50.0>>50.0 eggs in the first round of egg hunt.\nTank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt, meaning Emma collected 50.0-10=40.0 eggs\nThe total number of eggs Emma and Tank collected in the first round was 40.0+50.0=<<40.0+50.0=90.0>>90.0\nIn the two rounds, Emma and Tank gathered 90.0+90.0=<<90.0+90.0=180.0>>180.0 eggs\nIf the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, the six other people gathered 400-180.0=<<400-180.0=202.0>>202.0 eggs",
