  "flawed_nl_solution": "Half the characters have the initial A, which is a total of 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 characters.\nThis means that 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 characters have the initial C.\nMary wants the remaining 60 - 30 - 15 = <<60-30-15=15>>15 characters to have the initials D or E.\nFor there to be twice as many characters with the initial D, the characters are divided into 2 + 1 = <<2+1=5>>5 parts.\nDividing by this means there are 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 characters with the initial E.\nThis leaves 15 - 3 = <<15-3=12>>12 characters with the initial D.\n#### 12",
