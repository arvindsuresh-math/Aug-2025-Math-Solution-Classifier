  "flawed_nl_solution": "Carmela's four cousins have a total of $2 x 4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nThe total money they all have is $7 + $8 = $<<7+8=15>>15.\nThere will be 1 (Carmela) + 4 (cousins) = <<1+4=5>>5 people who will be sharing equally the money.\nSo each of them should get $15/5 = $<<15/5=3>>3.\nHence, Carmela has to give a total of $7 - $3 = $<<7-3=8>>8 to her 4 cousins.\nTherefore, each of her cousins will get $8/4 = $<<8/4=2>>2.\n#### 2",
