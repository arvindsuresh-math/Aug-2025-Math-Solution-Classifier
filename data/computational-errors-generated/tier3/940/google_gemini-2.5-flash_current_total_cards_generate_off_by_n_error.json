  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael so Mark has 100 cards - 10 cards = 90 cards.\nSo, Lloyd has 90 cards / 3 = <<90/3=30>>30 cards.\nAll three of them have 90 cards + 30 cards + 100 cards = <<90+30+100=215>>215 cards.\nThus, they need to collect 300 cards - 215 cards = <<300-215=85>>85 more cards.\n#### 85",
