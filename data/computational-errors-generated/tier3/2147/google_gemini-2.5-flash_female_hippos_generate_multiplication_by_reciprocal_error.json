  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of female hippos is 5/7*35=<<5/7*35=245/5>>245/5\nIf each new hippo gives birth to 5 new baby hippos, the total number of baby hippos will be 5*245/5=<<5*245/5=245>>245\nThe population of hippos after 245 new ones are born is 245+35=<<245+35=280>>280\nThere are 10 more newborn elephants than baby hippos, meaning there are 245+10=255 new baby elephants.\nThe population of elephants is 255+20=<<255+20=275>>275\nAltogether, there are 275+280=<<275+280=555>>555 animals",
