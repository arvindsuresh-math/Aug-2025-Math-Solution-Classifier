  "flawed_nl_solution": "If he gathers for 2 hours, the number of minutes gathering is 2 * 60 minutes per hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes of gathering flowers\nGathering for 120 minutes / 10 minutes per flower = <<120/10=12>>12 flowers gathered\nIf he gathers 12 flowers initially but lost 3, he has 12-3 = <<12-3=8>>8 flowers gathered and kept\nSince he has 30 classmates total and has 8 flowers, he needs to gather 30-8=<<30-8=22>>22 more flowers\nAssuming it takes 10 minutes per flower, it will take him 10 * 22 = <<10*22=220>>220 minutes to gather the remaining 22 flowers needed\n#### 220",
