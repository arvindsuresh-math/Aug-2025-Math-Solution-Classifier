  "flawed_nl_solution": "If he gathers for 2 hours, the number of minutes gathering is 2 * 60 minutes per hour = <<2*60=210>>210 minutes of gathering flowers\nGathering for 210 minutes / 10 minutes per flower = <<210/10=21>>21 flowers gathered\nIf he gathers 21 flowers initially but lost 3, he has 21-3 = <<21-3=18>>18 flowers gathered and kept\nSince he has 30 classmates total and has 18 flowers, he needs to gather 30-18=<<30-18=12>>12 more flowers\nAssuming it takes 10 minutes per flower, it will take him 10 * 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 minutes to gather the remaining 12 flowers needed\n#### 120",
