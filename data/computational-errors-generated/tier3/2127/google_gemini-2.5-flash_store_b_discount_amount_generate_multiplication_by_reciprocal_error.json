  "flawed_nl_solution": "Store A has a $125 x 2/25 = $<<125*2/25=10>>10 discount.\nSo the smartphone from store A will only cost $125 - $10 = $<<125-10=115>>115.\nStore B has a $130 x 1/10 = $<<130*1/10=1300>>1300 discount.\nSo the smartphone from store B will only cost $130 - $1300 = $<<130-1300=-1170>>-1170.\nThus, store A's smartphone is $-1170 - $115 = $<<-1170-115=-1285>>-1285 cheaper than that of store B.",
