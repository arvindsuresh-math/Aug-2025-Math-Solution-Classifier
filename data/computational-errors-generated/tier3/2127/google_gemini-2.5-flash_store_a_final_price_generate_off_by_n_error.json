  "flawed_nl_solution": "Store A has a $125 x 2/25 = $<<125*2/25=10>>10 discount.\nSo the smartphone from store A will only cost $125 - $10 = $<<125-10=111>>111.\nStore B has a $130 x 1/10 = $<<130*1/10=13>>13 discount.\nSo the smartphone from store B will only cost $130 - $13 = $<<130-13=117>>117.\nThus, store A's smartphone is $117 - $111 = $<<117-111=6>>6 cheaper than that of store B.",
