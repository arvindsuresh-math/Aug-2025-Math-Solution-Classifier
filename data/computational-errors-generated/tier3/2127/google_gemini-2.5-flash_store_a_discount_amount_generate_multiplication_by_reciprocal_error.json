  "flawed_nl_solution": "Store A has a $125 x 8/100 = $<<125*8/100=3125/2>>3125/2 discount.\nSo the smartphone from store A will only cost $125 - $3125/2 = $<<125-3125/2=-2875/2>>-2875/2.\nStore B has a $130 x 10/100 = $<<130*10/100=13>>13 discount.\nSo the smartphone from store B will only cost $130 - $13 = $<<130-13=117>>117.\nThus, store A's smartphone is $117 - $-2875/2 = $<<117--2875/2=3109/2>>3109/2 cheaper than that of store B.",
