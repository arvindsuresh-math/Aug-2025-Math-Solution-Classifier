  "flawed_nl_solution": "The blacksmith can create a total of 400kg iron / 2kg iron per horseshoe = <<400/2=200>>200 horseshoes.\nThe farms need enough horseshoes for 2 farms * 2 horses each = <<2*2=4>>4 horses.\nThe stables need enough horseshoes for 5 stables * 2 horses each = <<5*2=10>>10 horses.\nSo in total, the farms and stables have 4 + 10 = <<4+10=41>>41 horses that need horseshoes.\nThis is a total of 41 horses * 4 horseshoes per horse = <<41*4=164>>164 horseshoes.\nThis means the blacksmith has 200 total horseshoes - 164 horseshoes for the stables and farms = 36 horseshoes left for the riding school.\nThe riding school therefore will have enough horseshoes for 36 horseshoes / 4 horseshoes per horse = <<36/4=9>>9 horses.",
