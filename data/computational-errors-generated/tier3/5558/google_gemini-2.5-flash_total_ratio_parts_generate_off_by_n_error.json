  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the ratio of boys to girls in the math class is 5:8, the total ratio of the number of boys and girls in the math class is 5+8 = <<5+8=8>>8.\nThe fraction that represents the number of boys in the class is 5/8, and since there are 260 students in the class, the number of boys in the class is 5/8*260 = <<5/8*260=325/2>>325/2.\nThe number of girls in the class is 260-325/2 = <<260-325/2=195/2>>195/2.\n#### 195/2",
