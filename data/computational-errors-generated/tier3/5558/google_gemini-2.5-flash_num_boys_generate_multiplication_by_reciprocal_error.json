  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the ratio of boys to girls in the math class is 5:8, the total ratio of the number of boys and girls in the math class is 5+8 = <<5+8=13>>13.\nThe fraction that represents the number of boys in the class is 5/13, and since there are 260 students in the class, the number of boys in the class is 5/13*260 = <<5/13*260=3380/5>>3380/5.\nThe number of girls in the class is 260-3380/5 = <<260-3380/5=-416>>-416.\n#### -416",
