  "flawed_nl_solution": "Without the face cards and the 8's, there are 9 cards of each suit. Half these cards are red, and 3/9 have numbers divisible by 3, so the odds of drawing a card divisible by 3 are 1/2.\nMultiply the odds of drawing a red card by the odds of drawing a card divisible by 3 to find the odds of both things happening: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\nFinally, multiplying the probability of drawing a red/3-divisible card by the number of cards Mark draws to find how many he should expect to meet his criteria: 1/4 * 36 cards = <<1/4*36=9>>9 cards",
