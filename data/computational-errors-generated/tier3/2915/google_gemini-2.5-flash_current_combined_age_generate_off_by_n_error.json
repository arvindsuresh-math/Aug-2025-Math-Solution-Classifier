  "flawed_nl_solution": "At present, the two brothers have a combined age of 8 + 12 = <<8+12=16>>16 years old.\nTherefore, 1 year means an increase in the sum of their ages by 1 * 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 years.\nAdam and Tom need a total of 44 - 16 = <<44-16=28>>28 more years to be 44 years old together.\nSo both brothers will be 44 years old together after 28 / 2 = <<28/2=14>>14 years.\n#### 14",
