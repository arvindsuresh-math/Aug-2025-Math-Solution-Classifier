  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine how many feet Ian runs in a week. We begin this by multiplying the number of laps by the number of feet per lap, performing 5*100= <<5*100=500>>500 feet per day.\nSince there are 5 days in the period being measured, this means Ian runs 500*5= <<2050=2050>>2050 feet jogged.\nSince it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie, this means Ian burns 2050/25=<<2050/25=82.0>>82.0 calories burned jogging throughout the week.",
