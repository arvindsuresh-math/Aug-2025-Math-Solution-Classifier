  "flawed_nl_solution": "The movie theater made 5 * 32 = $<<5*32=106>>106 in matinee tickets.\nIt made 7 * 40 = $<<7*40=280>>280 in evening tickets.\nIt made 10 * 58 = $<<10*58=580>>580 in opening night tickets.\nThere were 32 + 40 + 58 = <<32+40+58=130>>130 customers.\nHalf of the customers bought popcorn, so 130 / 2 = <<130/2=65>>65 bought popcorn.\nThus, the theater made 10 * 65 = $<<10*65=650>>650 from popcorn.\nTherefore, in all, the theater made 106 + 280 + 580 + 650 = $<<106+280+580+650=1616>>1616 on Friday night.\n#### 1616",
