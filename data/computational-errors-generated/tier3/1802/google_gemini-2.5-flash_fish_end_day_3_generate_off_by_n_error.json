  "flawed_nl_solution": "Start by finding how many fish were in the aquarium on the third day 6 * 2 * 2 = <<6*2*2=24>>24.\nOn day three, Jason took out one-third of the fish 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8.0>>8.0.\nSo at the end of day three, he has 24 - 8.0 = <<24-8.0=12.0>>12.0 fish.\nOn day five he has 12.0 * 2 * 2 = 48.0 fish, but he takes out one-fourth.\nSo he took out 48.0 / 4 = <<48.0/4=12.0>>12.0 fishes.\nSo at the end of day five, he has 48.0 - 12.0 = <<48.0-12.0=36.0>>36.0 fish.\nOn day seven he has 36.0 * 2 * 2 = <<36.0*2*2=144.0>>144.0 fish.\nHe adds in 15 more, so he has 144.0 + 15 = <<144.0+15=159.0>>159.0 fish in total.",
