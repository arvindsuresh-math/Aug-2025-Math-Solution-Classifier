  "flawed_nl_solution": "Start by finding how many fish were in the aquarium on the third day 6 * 2 * 2 = <<6*2*2=24>>24.\nOn day three, Jason took out one-third of the fish 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8.\nSo at the end of day three, he has 24 - 8 = <<24-8=18>>18 fish.\nOn day five he has 18 * 2 * 2 = 72 fish, but he takes out one-fourth.\nSo he took out 72 / 4 = <<72/4=18>>18 fishes.\nSo at the end of day five, he has 72 - 18 = <<72-18=54>>54 fish.\nOn day seven he has 54 * 2 * 2 = <<54*2*2=216>>216 fish.\nHe adds in 15 more, so he has 216 + 15 = <<216+15=231>>231 fish in total.\n#### 231",
