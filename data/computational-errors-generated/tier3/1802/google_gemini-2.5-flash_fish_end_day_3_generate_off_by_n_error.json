  "flawed_nl_solution": "Start by finding how many fish were in the aquarium on the third day 6 * 2 * 2 = <<6*2*2=24>>24.\nOn day three, Jason took out one-third of the fish 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8.\nSo at the end of day three, he has 24 - 8 = <<24-8=13>>13 fish.\nOn day five he has 13 * 2 * 2 = 52 fish, but he takes out one-fourth.\nSo he took out 52 / 4 = <<52/4=13>>13 fishes.\nSo at the end of day five, he has 52 - 13 = <<52-13=39>>39 fish.\nOn day seven he has 39 * 2 * 2 = <<39*2*2=156>>156 fish.\nHe adds in 15 more, so he has 156 + 15 = <<156+15=171>>171 fish in total.\n#### 171",
