  "flawed_nl_solution": "Start by finding how many fish were in the aquarium on the third day 6 * 2 * 2 = <<6*2*2=24>>24.\nOn day three, Jason took out one-third of the fish 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8.\nSo at the end of day three, he has 24 - 8 = <<24-8=19>>19 fish.\nOn day five he has 19 * 2 * 2 = 76 fish, but he takes out one-fourth.\nSo he took out 76 / 4 = <<76/4=19>>19 fishes.\nSo at the end of day five, he has 76 - 19 = <<76-19=57>>57 fish.\nOn day seven he has 57 * 2 * 2 = <<57*2*2=228>>228 fish.\nHe adds in 15 more, so he has 228 + 15 = <<228+15=243>>243 fish in total.",
