  "flawed_nl_solution": "Start by finding how many fish were in the aquarium on the third day 6 * 2 * 2 = <<6*2*2=24>>24.\nOn day three, Jason took out one-third of the fish 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8.\nSo at the end of day three, he has 24 - 8 = <<24-8=21>>21 fish.\nOn day five he has 21 * 2 * 2 = 84 fish, but he takes out one-fourth.\nSo he took out 84 / 4 = <<84/4=21>>21 fishes.\nSo at the end of day five, he has 84 - 21 = <<84-21=63>>63 fish.\nOn day seven he has 63 * 2 * 2 = <<63*2*2=252>>252 fish.\nHe adds in 15 more, so he has 252 + 15 = <<252+15=267>>267 fish in total.\n#### 267",
