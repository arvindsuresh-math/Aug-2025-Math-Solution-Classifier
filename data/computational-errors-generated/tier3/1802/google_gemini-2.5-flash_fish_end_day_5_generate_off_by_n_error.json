  "flawed_nl_solution": "Start by finding how many fish were in the aquarium on the third day 6 * 2 * 2 = <<6*2*2=24>>24.\nOn day three, Jason took out one-third of the fish 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8.\nSo at the end of day three, he has 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>>16 fish.\nOn day five he has 16 * 2 * 2 = 64 fish, but he takes out one-fourth.\nSo he took out 64 / 4 = <<64/4=16>>16 fishes.\nSo at the end of day five, he has 64 - 16 = <<64-16=44>>44 fish.\nOn day seven he has 44 * 2 * 2 = <<44*2*2=176>>176 fish.\nHe adds in 15 more, so he has 176 + 15 = <<176+15=191>>191 fish in total.",
