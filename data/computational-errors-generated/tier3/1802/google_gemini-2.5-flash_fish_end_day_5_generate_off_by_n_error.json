  "flawed_nl_solution": "Start by finding how many fish were in the aquarium on the third day 6 * 2 * 2 = <<6*2*2=24>>24.\nOn day three, Jason took out one-third of the fish 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8.0>>8.0.\nSo at the end of day three, he has 24 - 8.0 = <<24-8.0=16.0>>16.0 fish.\nOn day five he has 16.0 * 2 * 2 = 64.0 fish, but he takes out one-fourth.\nSo he took out 64.0 / 4 = <<64.0/4=16.0>>16.0 fishes.\nSo at the end of day five, he has 64.0 - 16.0 = <<64.0-16.0=53.0>>53.0 fish.\nOn day seven he has 53.0 * 2 * 2 = <<53.0*2*2=212.0>>212.0 fish.\nHe adds in 15 more, so he has 212.0 + 15 = <<212.0+15=227.0>>227.0 fish in total.",
