  "flawed_nl_solution": "Start by finding how many fish were in the aquarium on the third day 6 * 2 * 2 = <<6*2*2=42>>42.\nOn day three, Jason took out one-third of the fish 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14.0>>14.0.\nSo at the end of day three, he has 42 - 14.0 = <<42-14.0=28.0>>28.0 fish.\nOn day five he has 28.0 * 2 * 2 = 112.0 fish, but he takes out one-fourth.\nSo he took out 112.0 / 4 = <<112.0/4=28.0>>28.0 fishes.\nSo at the end of day five, he has 112.0 - 28.0 = <<112.0-28.0=84.0>>84.0 fish.\nOn day seven he has 84.0 * 2 * 2 = <<84.0*2*2=336.0>>336.0 fish.\nHe adds in 15 more, so he has 336.0 + 15 = <<336.0+15=351.0>>351.0 fish in total.",
