  "flawed_nl_solution": "Abe is spending a third of his budget on food, so he spends $3000 / 3 = $<<3000/3=1000>>1000 on food.\nHe spends a quarter of his budget on restaurant supplies, so he spends $3000 / 4 = $<<3000/4=750>>750 on supplies.\nThus, he spends $3000 - $1000 - $750 = $<<3000-1000-750=1520>>1520 on employee wages every month.\n#### 1520",
