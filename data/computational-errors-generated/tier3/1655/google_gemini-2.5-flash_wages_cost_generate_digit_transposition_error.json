  "flawed_nl_solution": "Abe is spending a third of his budget on food, so he spends $3000 / 3 = $<<3000/3=1000.0>>1000.0 on food.\nHe spends a quarter of his budget on restaurant supplies, so he spends $3000 / 4 = $<<3000/4=750.0>>750.0 on supplies.\nThus, he spends $3000 - $1000.0 - $750.0 = $<<3000-1000.0-750.0=2150.0>>2150.0 on employee wages every month.",
