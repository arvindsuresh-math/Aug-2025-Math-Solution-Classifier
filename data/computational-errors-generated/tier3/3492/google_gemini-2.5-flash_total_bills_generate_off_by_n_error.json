  "flawed_nl_solution": "His $20 bills amount to 4 x $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nSo the total amount of the $10 and $20 bills is $80 + $50 = $<<80+50=130>>130.\nHence, the remaining $5 bills amount to $150 - $130 = $20.\nThis means that there are $20/$5 = <<20/5=4>>4 $5 bills.\nThere are also $50/$10 = 5 $10 bills.\nTherefore, Samuel has 4 + 4 + 5 = <<4+4+5=16>>16 bills in his wallet.\n#### 16",
