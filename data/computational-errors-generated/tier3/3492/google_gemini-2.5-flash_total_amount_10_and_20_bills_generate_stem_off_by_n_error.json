  "flawed_nl_solution": "His $20 bills amount to 4 x $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nSo the total amount of the $10 and $20 bills is $80 + $50 = $<<80+50=110>>110.\nHence, the remaining $5 bills amount to $150 - $110 = $40.\nThis means that there are $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 $5 bills.\nThere are also $50/$10 = 5 $10 bills.\nTherefore, Samuel has 8 + 4 + 5 = <<8+4+5=17>>17 bills in his wallet.\n#### 17",
