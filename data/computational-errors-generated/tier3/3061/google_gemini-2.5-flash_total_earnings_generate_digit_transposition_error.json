  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mikaela spent 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 hours in the second month.\nSo, she tutored a total of 35 + 40 = <<35+40=75>>75 hours for the first two months.\nThus, her total earning was 75 x $10 = $<<75*10=705>>705.\nAnd, her total expenses was 4/5 x $705 = $<<4/5*705=564>>564.\nTherefore, she saved an amount of $705 - $564 = $<<705-564=141>>141.\n#### 141",
