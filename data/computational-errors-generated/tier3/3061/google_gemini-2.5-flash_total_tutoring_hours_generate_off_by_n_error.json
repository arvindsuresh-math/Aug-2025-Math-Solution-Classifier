  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mikaela spent 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 hours in the second month.\nSo, she tutored a total of 35 + 40 = <<35+40=73>>73 hours for the first two months.\nThus, her total earning was 73 x $10 = $<<73*10=730>>730.\nAnd, her total expenses was 4/5 x $730 = $<<4/5*730=584>>584.\nTherefore, she saved an amount of $730 - $584 = $<<730-584=146>>146.\n#### 146",
