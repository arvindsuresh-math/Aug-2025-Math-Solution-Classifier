  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mikaela spent 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 hours in the second month.\nSo, she tutored a total of 35 + 40 = <<35+40=75>>75 hours for the first two months.\nThus, her total earning was 75 x $10 = $<<75*10=750>>750.\nAnd, her total expenses was 4/5 x $750 = $<<4/5*750=3750/4>>3750/4.\nTherefore, she saved an amount of $750 - $3750/4 = $<<750-3750/4=-375/2>>-375/2.\n#### -375/2",
