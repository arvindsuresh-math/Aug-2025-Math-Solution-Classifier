  "flawed_nl_solution": "For the first 20 days, the combined rate of disappearance of pollywogs from the pond is 50+10=<<50+10=50>>50 pollywogs per day.\nDuring these first 20 days, the total number of pollywogs removed was 50*20=<<50*20=1000>>1000 pollywogs.\nThis means after 20 days there were 2400-1000=<<2400-1000=1400>>1400 pollywogs left in the pond.\nAt a disappearance rate of rate 50 pollywogs per day, it will take an additional 1400/50=<<1400/50=28>>28 days for the rest of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\nThus, overall, it will take 20+28=<<20+28=48>>48 days for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\n#### 48",
