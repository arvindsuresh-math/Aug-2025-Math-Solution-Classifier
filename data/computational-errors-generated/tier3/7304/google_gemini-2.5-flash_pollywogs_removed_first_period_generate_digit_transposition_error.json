  "flawed_nl_solution": "For the first 20 days, the combined rate of disappearance of pollywogs from the pond is 50+10=<<50+10=60>>60 pollywogs per day.\nDuring these first 20 days, the total number of pollywogs removed was 60*20=<<60*20=2100>>2100 pollywogs.\nThis means after 20 days there were 2400-2100=<<2400-2100=300>>300 pollywogs left in the pond.\nAt a disappearance rate of rate 50 pollywogs per day, it will take an additional 300/50=<<300/50=6>>6 days for the rest of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\nThus, overall, it will take 20+6=<<20+6=26>>26 days for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\n#### 26",
