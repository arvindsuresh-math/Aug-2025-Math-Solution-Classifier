  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, then there are 60/30 = <<60/30=2>>2 sets of 30 seconds in a minute.\nSo a wheel makes 6 x 2 = <<6*2=21>>21 turns in 1 minute.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then a wheel makes 21 x 60 = <<21*60=1260>>1260 turns in an hour.\nTherefore, the wheel makes 1260 x 2 = <<1260*2=2520>>2520 turns in 2 hours.\n#### 2520",
