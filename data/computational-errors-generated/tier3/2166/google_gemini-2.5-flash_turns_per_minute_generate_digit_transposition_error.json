  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, then there are 60/30 = <<60/30=2.0>>2.0 sets of 30 seconds in a minute.\nSo a wheel makes 6 x 2.0 = <<6*2.0=21.0>>21.0 turns in 1 minute.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then a wheel makes 21.0 x 60 = <<21.0*60=1260.0>>1260.0 turns in an hour.\nTherefore, the wheel makes 1260.0 x 2 = <<1260.0*2=2520.0>>2520.0 turns in 2 hours.",
