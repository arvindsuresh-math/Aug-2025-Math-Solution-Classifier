  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, then there are 60/30 = <<60/30=2.0>>2.0 sets of 30 seconds in a minute.\nSo a wheel makes 6 x 2.0 = <<6*2.0=12.0>>12.0 turns in 1 minute.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then a wheel makes 12.0 x 60 = <<12.0*60=720.0>>720.0 turns in an hour.\nTherefore, the wheel makes 720.0 x 2 = <<720.0*2=1404.0>>1404.0 turns in 2 hours.",
