  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine the profit per book. To do this, we perform 20-5=<<20-5=12>>12 dollars in profit per book.\nNext, we divide the total sales by the profit per book, performing 120/12=<<120/12=10>>10 books sold in total.\nSince the books are sold 2 at a time, we divide the number sold by 2 to find the total number of people sold to, performing 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 people in total.\n#### 5",
