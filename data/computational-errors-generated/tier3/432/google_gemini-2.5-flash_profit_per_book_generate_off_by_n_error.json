  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine the profit per book. To do this, we perform 20-5=<<20-5=20>>20 dollars in profit per book.\nNext, we divide the total sales by the profit per book, performing 120/20=<<120/20=6.0>>6.0 books sold in total.\nSince the books are sold 2 at a time, we divide the number sold by 2 to find the total number of people sold to, performing 6.0/2=<<6.0/2=3.0>>3.0 people in total.",
