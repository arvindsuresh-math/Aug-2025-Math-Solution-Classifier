  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine the profit per book. To do this, we perform 20-5=<<20-5=10>>10 dollars in profit per book.\nNext, we divide the total sales by the profit per book, performing 120/10=<<120/10=12>>12 books sold in total.\nSince the books are sold 2 at a time, we divide the number sold by 2 to find the total number of people sold to, performing 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 people in total.\n#### 6",
