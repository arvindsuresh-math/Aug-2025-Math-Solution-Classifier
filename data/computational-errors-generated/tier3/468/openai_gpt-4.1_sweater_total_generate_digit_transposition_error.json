  "flawed_nl_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=27>>27.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $27 + $360 = $<<48+27+360=435>>435.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $435 = $<<5/100*435=87/4>>87/4.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $435 + $87/4 = $<<435+87/4=1827/4>>1827/4. including the sales tax.",
