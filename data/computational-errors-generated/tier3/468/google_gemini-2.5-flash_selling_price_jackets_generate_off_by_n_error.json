  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 6 T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe 4 sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd 5 jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 1/10 x $400 = $<<1/10*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=359>>359.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $359 = $<<48+72+359=479>>479.\nThe sales tax is equal to 1/20 x $479 = $<<1/20*479=479/20>>479/20.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $479 + $479/20 = $<<479+479/20=10059/20>>10059/20. including the sales tax.",
