  "flawed_nl_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 1/10 x $400 = $<<1/10*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=365>>365.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $365 = $<<48+72+365=485>>485.\nThe sales tax is equal to 1/20 x $485 = $<<1/20*485=97/4>>97/4.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $485 + $97/4 = $<<485+97/4=2037/4>>2037/4. including the sales tax.",
