  "flawed_nl_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=40>>40.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $40 = $<<10/100*40=4>>4 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $40 - $4 = $<<40-4=36>>36.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $36 = $<<48+72+36=156>>156.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $156 = $<<5/100*156=39/5>>39/5.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $156 + $39/5 = $<<156+39/5=819/5>>819/5. including the sales tax.",
