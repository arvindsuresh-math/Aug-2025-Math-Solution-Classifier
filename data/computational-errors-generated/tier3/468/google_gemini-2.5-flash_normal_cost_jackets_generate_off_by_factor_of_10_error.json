  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 6 T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe 4 sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd 5 jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=4000>>4000.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $4000 = $<<10/100*4000=400>>400 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $4000 - $400 = $<<4000-400=3600>>3600.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $3600 = $<<48+72+3600=3720>>3720.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $3720 = $<<5/100*3720=186>>186.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $3720 + $186 = $<<3720+186=3906>>3906. including the sales tax.",
