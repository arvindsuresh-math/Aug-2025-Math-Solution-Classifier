  "flawed_nl_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 1/10 x $400 = $<<1/10*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 1/20 x $480 = $<<1/20*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=540>>540. including the sales tax.",
