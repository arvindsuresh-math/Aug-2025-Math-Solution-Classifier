  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ivan has 50 x 10 = <<50*10=500>>500 cents from the 50 dimes in his one piggy bank.\nSo, he has a total of 100 + 500 = <<100+500=6000>>6000 cents in one of his piggy banks.\nSince 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, then Ivan has 6000/100 = 60 dollars from one of his piggy banks.\nTherefore, Ivan has a total of $60 x 2 piggy banks = $<<60*2=120>>120 from his two piggy banks.\n#### 120",
