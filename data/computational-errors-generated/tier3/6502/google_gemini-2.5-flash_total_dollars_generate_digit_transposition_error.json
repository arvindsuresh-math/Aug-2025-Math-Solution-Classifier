  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ivan has 50 x 10 = <<50*10=500>>500 cents from the 50 dimes in his one piggy bank.\nSo, he has a total of 100 + 500 = <<100+500=600>>600 cents in one of his piggy banks.\nSince 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, then Ivan has 600/100 = 6 dollars from one of his piggy banks.\nTherefore, Ivan has a total of $6 x 2 piggy banks = $<<6*2=21>>21 from his two piggy banks.\n#### 21",
