  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many minutes Carson spends at the carnival by multiplying the number of hours he's there by the number of minutes per hour: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=420>>420 minutes\nThen figure out how long Carson spends waiting for the roller coaster by multiplying the wait time per ride by the number of rides: 4 rides * 30 minutes/ride = <<4*30=120>>120 minutes\nNow subtract the time Carson spends on the roller coaster and tilt-a-whirl from the total time he spends at the park to find out how much time he has left: 420 minutes - 120 minutes - 60 minutes = <<420-120-60=240>>240 minutes\nNow divide the time Carson has left by the wait time for the giant slide to see how many times he can ride it: 240 minutes / 15 minutes/ride = <<240/15=16.0>>16.0 rides",
