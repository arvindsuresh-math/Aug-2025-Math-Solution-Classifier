  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 60 minutes in an hour and she packs chocolate in 5-minute increments. So that's 60/5 = <<60/5=12>>12 5 minute increments in 1 hour\n12 chocolates make 1 dozen and she packages 2 dozen in 5 minutes so that's 12*2 = <<12*2=42>>42 chocolates in 5 minutes\n12 5 minute increments are in an hour and she packages 42 chocolates in 5 minutes so she can package 12*42 = <<12*42=504>>504 individual chocolates in 1 hour\nIf she packages 504 individual chocolates in 1 hour then in 4 hours she can package 504*4 = <<504*4=2016>>2016 individual chocolates\n#### 2016",
