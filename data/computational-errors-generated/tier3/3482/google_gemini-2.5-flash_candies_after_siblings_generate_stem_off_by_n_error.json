  "flawed_nl_solution": "Cersei gave a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cotton candies to her brother and sister.\nSo, the total cotton candies left were 50 - 10 = <<50-10=10>>10.\nAnd she gave 1/4 x 10 = <<1/4*10=5/2>>5/2 cotton candies to her cousin.\nSo, the total number of cotton candies left was 10 - 5/2 = <<10-5/2=15/2>>15/2.\nTherefore, the total number of cotton candies left after she ate 12 of them is 15/2 - 12 = <<15/2-12=-9/2>>-9/2.\n#### -9/2",
