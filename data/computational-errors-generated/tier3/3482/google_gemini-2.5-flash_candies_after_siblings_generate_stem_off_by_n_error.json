  "flawed_nl_solution": "Cersei gave a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cotton candies to her brother and sister.\nSo, the total cotton candies left were 50 - 10 = <<50-10=60>>60.\nAnd she gave 1/4 x 60 = <<1/4*60=15>>15 cotton candies to her cousin.\nSo, the total number of cotton candies left was 60 - 15 = <<60-15=45>>45.\nTherefore, the total number of cotton candies left after she ate 12 of them is 45 - 12 = <<45-12=33>>33.\n#### 33",
