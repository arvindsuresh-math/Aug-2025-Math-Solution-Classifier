  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Eliza restocked twice the original number of ornamental rings, the number was 200/2= <<200/2=100.0>>100.0 rings.\nThe total number of ornamental rings in stock is now 200+100.0 = <<200+100.0=300.0>>300.0 rings.\nWhen she sells 3/4 of the stock, the total number of rings sold is 3/4*300.0 =<<3/4*300.0=252.0>>252.0 rings.\nThe remaining stock is 300.0-252.0 = <<300.0-252.0=48.0>>48.0 rings.\nWhen her mother buys 300 more rings, the stock is boosted to 48.0+300 = <<48.0+300=348.0>>348.0 rings.\nShe then sells out 150, reducing the stock to 348.0-150 = 198.0 rings",
