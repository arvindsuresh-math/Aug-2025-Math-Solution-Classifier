  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Eliza restocked twice the original number of ornamental rings, the number was 200/2= <<200/2=100.0>>100.0 rings.\nThe total number of ornamental rings in stock is now 200+100.0 = <<200+100.0=296.0>>296.0 rings.\nWhen she sells 3/4 of the stock, the total number of rings sold is 3/4*296.0 =<<3/4*296.0=222.0>>222.0 rings.\nThe remaining stock is 296.0-222.0 = <<296.0-222.0=74.0>>74.0 rings.\nWhen her mother buys 300 more rings, the stock is boosted to 74.0+300 = <<74.0+300=374.0>>374.0 rings.\nShe then sells out 150, reducing the stock to 374.0-150 = 224.0 rings",
