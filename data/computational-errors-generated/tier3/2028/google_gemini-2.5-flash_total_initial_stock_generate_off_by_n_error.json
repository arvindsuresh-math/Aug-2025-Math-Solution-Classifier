  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Eliza restocked twice the original number of ornamental rings, the number was 200/2= <<200/2=100>>100 rings.\nThe total number of ornamental rings in stock is now 200+100 = <<200+100=304>>304 rings.\nWhen she sells 3/4 of the stock, the total number of rings sold is 3/4*304 =<<3/4*304=228>>228 rings.\nThe remaining stock is 304-228 = <<304-228=76>>76 rings.\nWhen her mother buys 300 more rings, the stock is boosted to 76+300 = <<76+300=376>>376 rings.\nShe then sells out 150, reducing the stock to 376-150 = 226 rings\n#### 226",
