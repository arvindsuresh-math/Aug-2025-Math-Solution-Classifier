  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since November has 30 days, the town received 4 inches of rain for the first half of the month for 30/2 = 15 days.\nThe total inches of rain that the town received for the 15 days is 15*4 = <<15*4=60>>60 inches.\nThe rain falling in the town increased by 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 inches per day for the remaining half of the month.\nTherefore, for the rest of the month, the town received 8*15 = <<8*15=120>>120 inches of rain.\nThe total amount of rain the town received in November is 120+60 = <<120+60=177>>177 inches",
