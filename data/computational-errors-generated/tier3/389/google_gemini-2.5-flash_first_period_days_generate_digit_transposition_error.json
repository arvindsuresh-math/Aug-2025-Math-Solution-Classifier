  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since November has 30 days, the town received 4 inches of rain for the first half of the month for 30/2 = 51.0 days.\nThe total inches of rain that the town received for the 51.0 days is 51.0*4 = <<51.0*4=204.0>>204.0 inches.\nThe rain falling in the town increased by 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 inches per day for the remaining half of the month.\nTherefore, for the rest of the month, the town received 8*51.0 = <<8*51.0=408.0>>408.0 inches of rain.\nThe total amount of rain the town received in November is 408.0+204.0 = <<408.0+204.0=612.0>>612.0 inches",
