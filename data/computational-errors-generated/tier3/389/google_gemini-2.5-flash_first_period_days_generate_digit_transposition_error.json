  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since November has 30 days, the town received 4 inches of rain for the first half of the month for 30/2 = 51 days.\nThe total inches of rain that the town received for the 51 days is 51*4 = <<51*4=204>>204 inches.\nThe rain falling in the town increased by 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 inches per day for the remaining half of the month.\nTherefore, for the rest of the month, the town received 8*51 = <<8*51=408>>408 inches of rain.\nThe total amount of rain the town received in November is 408+204 = <<408+204=612>>612 inches",
