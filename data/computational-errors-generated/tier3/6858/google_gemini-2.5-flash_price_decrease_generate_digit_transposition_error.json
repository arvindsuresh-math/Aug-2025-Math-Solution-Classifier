  "flawed_nl_solution": "There was a $1200 x 10/100 = $<<1200*10/100=120>>120 increase of the original price.\nSo, the perfume was priced for $1200 + $120 = $<<1200+120=1320>>1320.\nThen, 15% of the new price is $1320 x 15/100 = $<<1320*15/100=918>>918.\nSo, the final price is now $1320 - $918 = $<<1320-918=402>>402.\nTherefore, the final price is $1200 - $402 = $<<1200-402=798>>798 lower than the original price.\n#### 798",
