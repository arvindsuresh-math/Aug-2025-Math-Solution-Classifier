  "flawed_nl_solution": "If one \"AVN\" is half the price of one \"The Dark\" CD, that means one CD of \"The Dark\" costs 12 * 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.\nSo for 2 \"The Dark\" CDs, Alan needs to pay 24 * 2 = $<<24*2=48>>48.\nSo all CDs cost by now 12 + 48 = $<<12+48=60>>60.\nThe 90s music CDs cost 40/100 * 60 = $<<40/100*60=300/2>>300/2.\nThat means for all CDs Alan needs to pay 60 + 300/2 = $<<60+300/2=210>>210.\n#### 210",
