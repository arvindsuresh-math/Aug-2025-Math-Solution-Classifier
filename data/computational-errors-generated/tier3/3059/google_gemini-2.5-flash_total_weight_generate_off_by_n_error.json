  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog, the black dog weighs 1 + 4 = <<1+4=5>>5 pounds.\nThe white dog weighs 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds.\nBecause the grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog, the grey dog weighs 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 pounds.\nThe total weight of all dogs is 4 + 5 + 8 + 3 = <<4+5+8+3=24>>24 pounds.\nThe average weight of all the dogs is 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 pounds.\n#### 6",
