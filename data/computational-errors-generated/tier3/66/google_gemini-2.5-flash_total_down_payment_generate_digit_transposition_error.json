  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 1/5 = $<<1000*1/5=200>>200 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $<<200+20=202>>202.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $202 = $<<1000-202=798>>798.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $798/year / 12 months/year = $<<798/12=66.5>>66.5/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $66.5/month x 4 months = $<<66.5*4=266>>266.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $798 - $266 = $<<798-266=532>>532.",
