  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=200>>200 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $<<200+20=220>>220.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $<<1000-220=708>>708.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $708/year / 12 months/year = $<<708/12=59>>59/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $59/month x 4 months = $<<59*4=236>>236.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $708 - $236 = $<<708-236=472>>472.",
