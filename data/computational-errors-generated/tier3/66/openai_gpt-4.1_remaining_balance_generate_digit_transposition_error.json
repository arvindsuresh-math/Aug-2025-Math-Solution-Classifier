  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=200.0>>200.0 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200.0 + $20 = $<<200.0+20=220.0>>220.0.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220.0 = $<<1000-220.0=708.0>>708.0.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $708.0/year / 12 months/year = $<<708.0/12=59.0>>59.0/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $59.0/month x 4 months = $<<59.0*4=236.0>>236.0.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $708.0 - $236.0 = $<<708.0-236.0=472.0>>472.0.",
