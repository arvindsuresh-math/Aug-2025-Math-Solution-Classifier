  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=20.0>>20.0 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $20.0 + $20 = $<<20.0+20=40.0>>40.0.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $40.0 = $<<1000-40.0=960.0>>960.0.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $960.0/year / 12 months/year = $<<960.0/12=80.0>>80.0/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $80.0/month x 4 months = $<<80.0*4=320.0>>320.0.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $960.0 - $320.0 = $<<960.0-320.0=640.0>>640.0.",
