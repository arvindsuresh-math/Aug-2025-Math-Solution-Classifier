  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=20>>20 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $20 + $20 = $<<20+20=40>>40.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $40 = $<<1000-40=960>>960.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $960/year / 12 months/year = $<<960/12=80>>80/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $80/month x 4 months = $<<80*4=320>>320.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $960 - $320 = $<<960-320=640>>640.\n#### 640",
