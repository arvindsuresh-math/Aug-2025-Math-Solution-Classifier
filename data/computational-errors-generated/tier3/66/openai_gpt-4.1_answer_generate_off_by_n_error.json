  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=200.0>>200.0 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200.0 + $20 = $<<200.0+20=220.0>>220.0.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220.0 = $<<1000-220.0=780.0>>780.0.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $780.0/year / 12 months/year = $<<780.0/12=65.0>>65.0/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65.0/month x 4 months = $<<65.0*4=260.0>>260.0.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780.0 - $260.0 = $<<780.0-260.0=517.0>>517.0.",
