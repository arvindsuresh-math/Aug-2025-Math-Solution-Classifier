  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 1/5 = $<<1000*1/5=5000>>5000 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $5000 + $20 = $<<5000+20=5020>>5020.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $5020 = $<<1000-5020=-4020>>-4020.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $-4020/year / 12 months/year = $<<-4020/12=-335>>-335/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $-335/month x 4 months = $<<-335*4=-1340>>-1340.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $-4020 - $-1340 = $<<-4020--1340=-2680>>-2680.",
