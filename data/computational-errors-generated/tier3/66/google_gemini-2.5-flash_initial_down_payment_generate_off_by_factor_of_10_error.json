  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 1/5 = $<<1000*1/5=2000>>2000 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $2000 + $20 = $<<2000+20=2020>>2020.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $2020 = $<<1000-2020=-1020>>-1020.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $-1020/year / 12 months/year = $<<-1020/12=-85>>-85/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $-85/month x 4 months = $<<-85*4=-340>>-340.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $-1020 - $-340 = $<<-1020--340=-680>>-680.",
