  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the electricity bill costs $800, and Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, she pays $800+$400 = $<<800+400=1200>>1200 on cell phone expenses.\nSince the cost to enter the tournament is 1/5*1200 = $<<1/5*1200=204>>204 more than her monthly cell phone expenses.\nThe total cost of joining the golf tournament is $1200+$204 = $<<1200+204=1404>>1404",
