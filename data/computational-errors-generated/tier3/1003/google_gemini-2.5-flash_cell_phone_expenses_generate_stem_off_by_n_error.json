  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the electricity bill costs $800, and Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, she pays $800+$400 = $<<800+400=1170>>1170 on cell phone expenses.\nSince the cost to enter the tournament is 20/100*1170 = $<<20/100*1170=234>>234 more than her monthly cell phone expenses.\nThe total cost of joining the golf tournament is $1170+$234 = $<<1170+234=1404>>1404\n#### 1404",
