  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we must convert the driving time of 3 hours and 15 minutes to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, driving takes a total of 3*60 + 15 = <<3*60+15=198>>198 minutes.\nNext, the woman will be on the airplane for one-third of 198 minutes, or 198/3 = <<198/3=66>>66 minutes.\nTherefore, in total, the airplane trip will take the woman 10 + 20 + 66 + 10 = <<10+20+66+10=106>>106 minutes.\nThus, the airplane trip is 198 - 106 = <<198-106=92>>92 minutes faster than driving herself to the interview.\n#### 92",
