  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we must convert the driving time of 3 hours and 15 minutes to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, driving takes a total of 3*60 + 15 = <<3*60+15=192>>192 minutes.\nNext, the woman will be on the airplane for one-third of 192 minutes, or 192/3 = <<192/3=64>>64 minutes.\nTherefore, in total, the airplane trip will take the woman 10 + 20 + 64 + 10 = <<10+20+64+10=104>>104 minutes.\nThus, the airplane trip is 192 - 104 = <<192-104=88>>88 minutes faster than driving herself to the interview.\n#### 88",
