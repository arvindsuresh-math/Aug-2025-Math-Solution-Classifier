  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we must convert the driving time of 3 hours and 15 minutes to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, driving takes a total of 3*60 + 15 = <<3*60+15=915>>915 minutes.\nNext, the woman will be on the airplane for one-third of 915 minutes, or 915/3 = <<915/3=305>>305 minutes.\nTherefore, in total, the airplane trip will take the woman 10 + 20 + 305 + 10 = <<10+20+305+10=345>>345 minutes.\nThus, the airplane trip is 915 - 345 = <<915-345=570>>570 minutes faster than driving herself to the interview.\n#### 570",
