  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we must convert the driving time of 3 hours and 15 minutes to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, driving takes a total of 3*60 + 15 = <<3*60+15=159>>159 minutes.\nNext, the woman will be on the airplane for one-third of 159 minutes, or 159/3 = <<159/3=53.0>>53.0 minutes.\nTherefore, in total, the airplane trip will take the woman 10 + 20 + 53.0 + 10 = <<10+20+53.0+10=93.0>>93.0 minutes.\nThus, the airplane trip is 159 - 93.0 = <<159-93.0=66.0>>66.0 minutes faster than driving herself to the interview.",
