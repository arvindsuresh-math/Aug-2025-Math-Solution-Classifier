  "flawed_nl_solution": "Taking the boxes of pans out of the total attic boxes shows that 26 boxes - 6 boxes of pans = 22 boxes are either decorations or teacups.\nSince half of these boxes are decorations, the other half must be made up of 22 boxes / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 boxes of teacups.\nEach box of cups initially has 5 rows x 4 cups = <<5*4=20>>20 teacups inside.\nSamuel breaks cups each time he picks up a box, which means each box now contains 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 teacups.\nTherefore, there are 11 boxes * 18 teacups = <<11*18=198>>198 teacups left.\n#### 198",
