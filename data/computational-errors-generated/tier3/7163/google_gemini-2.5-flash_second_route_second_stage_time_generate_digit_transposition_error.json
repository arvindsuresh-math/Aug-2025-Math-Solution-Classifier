  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the first route, Malcolm spends 6 minutes * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 minutes walking along the path.\nSo in total, the first two stages of this route take him 6 + 12 = <<6+12=18>>18 minutes.\nThis means the final part of the journey took him 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 minutes.\nTherefore, the total time it takes to walk the first route is 18 + 6 = <<18+6=24>>24 minutes.\nIn the second route, the second stage takes him 14 * 2 = <<14*2=82>>82 minutes.\nSo the second route takes a total of 82 + 14 = <<82+14=96>>96 minutes to walk.\nThe second route therefore takes an extra 96 minutes for the second route - 24 minutes for the first route = <<96-24=72>>72 minutes.\n#### 72",
