  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the first route, Malcolm spends 6 minutes * 2 = <<6*2=21>>21 minutes walking along the path.\nSo in total, the first two stages of this route take him 6 + 21 = <<6+21=27>>27 minutes.\nThis means the final part of the journey took him 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 minutes.\nTherefore, the total time it takes to walk the first route is 27 + 9 = <<27+9=36>>36 minutes.\nIn the second route, the second stage takes him 14 * 2 = <<14*2=28>>28 minutes.\nSo the second route takes a total of 28 + 14 = <<28+14=42>>42 minutes to walk.\nThe second route therefore takes an extra 42 minutes for the second route - 36 minutes for the first route = <<42-36=6>>6 minutes.\n#### 6",
