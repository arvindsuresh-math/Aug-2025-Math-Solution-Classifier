  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the first route, Malcolm spends 6 minutes * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 minutes walking along the path.\nSo in total, the first two stages of this route take him 6 + 12 = <<6+12=21>>21 minutes.\nThis means the final part of the journey took him 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 minutes.\nTherefore, the total time it takes to walk the first route is 21 + 7 = <<21+7=28>>28 minutes.\nIn the second route, the second stage takes him 14 * 2 = <<14*2=28>>28 minutes.\nSo the second route takes a total of 28 + 14 = <<28+14=42>>42 minutes to walk.\nThe second route therefore takes an extra 42 minutes for the second route - 28 minutes for the first route = <<42-28=14>>14 minutes.\n#### 14",
