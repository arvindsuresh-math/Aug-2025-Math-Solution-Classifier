  "flawed_nl_solution": "At their following away game, Lola's team scored half as many points as at their home game, so they scored 62 / 2 = <<62/2=31>>31 points.\nAt the second away game, they scored 31 + 18 = <<31+18=49>>49 points.\nAt the third away game, they scored 49 + 2 = <<49+2=47>>47 points.\nA cumulative score of four times their last home game is 4 * 62 = <<4*62=248>>248 points.\nThus, Lola's team has to score 248 - 189 = <<248-189=59>>59 points to bring their cumulative points up to 248.\n#### 59",
