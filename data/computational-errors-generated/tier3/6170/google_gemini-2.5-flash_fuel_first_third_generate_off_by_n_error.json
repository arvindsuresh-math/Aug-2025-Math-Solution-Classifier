  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the second third of the trip, Lydia is going to use 60 liters of fuel / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 liters of fuel.\nIn the final third of the trip, she needs half of this amount so she is going to be using 20 liters / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 liters of fuel.\nSo in the first third, Lydia used the remaining amount of fuel which is 60 total liters of fuel - 20 liters of fuel in the second third - 10 liters of fuel in the final third = <<60-20-10=35>>35 liters of fuel.\n#### 35",
