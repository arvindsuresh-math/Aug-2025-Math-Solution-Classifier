  "flawed_nl_solution": "They spend 15 minutes/trip + 30 minutes/trip = <<15+30=45>>45 minutes/trip filling the car and driving to the new house.\nThey had to take 6 trips, so they spend 45 minutes/trip x 6/trip = <<45*6=270>>270 minutes.\nThey also had to drive back to their previous house 5 times to complete the move: 30 minutes/trip x 5 trips = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes.\nIn total, they spent 270 minutes + 150 minutes = <<270+150=240>>240 minutes.\nEach hour has 60 minutes so they spent 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<240/60=4>>4 hours in total.\n#### 4",
