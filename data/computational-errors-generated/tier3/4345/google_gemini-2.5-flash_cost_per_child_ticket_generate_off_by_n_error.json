  "flawed_nl_solution": "They gave the cashier $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nSince a $1 change was returned, this means the tickets cost $40 - $1 = $<<40-1=39>>39.\nTwo adult tickets cost $9 x 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18.\nSo, $39 - $18 = $<<39-18=21>>21 was spent for the children's tickets.\nEach child's ticket costs $9 - $2 = $<<9-2=3>>3.\nTherefore, there are $21/$3 = <<21/3=7>>7 children.\n#### 7",
