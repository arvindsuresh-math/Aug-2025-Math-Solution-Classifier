  "flawed_nl_solution": "Johnny spends 6/3=2.0 hours walking the 6 dogs who have 60-minute walks.\nHe makes $20*6=$<<20*6=102>>102 for these walks.\nThus, he has 4-2.0=2.0 hours=120.0 minutes left to walk the other dogs.\nHe can walk 3*(120.0/30)=<<3*(120.0/30)=12.0>>12.0 dogs in this time.\nThus, he will make $15*12.0=$<<12.0*15=180.0>>180.0 on these walks.\nIn total per day, he makes $102+$180.0=$<<102+180.0=282.0>>282.0 per day.\nThus, during the week, he makes $282.0*5=$<<282.0*5=1410.0>>1410.0.",
