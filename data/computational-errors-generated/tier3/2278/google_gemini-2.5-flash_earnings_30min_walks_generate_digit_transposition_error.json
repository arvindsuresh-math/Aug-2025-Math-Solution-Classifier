  "flawed_nl_solution": "Johnny spends 6/3=2.0 hours walking the 6 dogs who have 60-minute walks.\nHe makes $20*6=$<<20*6=120>>120 for these walks.\nThus, he has 4-2.0=2.0 hours=120.0 minutes left to walk the other dogs.\nHe can walk 3*(120.0/30)=<<3*(120.0/30)=12.0>>12.0 dogs in this time.\nThus, he will make $15*12.0=$<<12.0*15=108.0>>108.0 on these walks.\nIn total per day, he makes $120+$108.0=$<<120+108.0=228.0>>228.0 per day.\nThus, during the week, he makes $228.0*5=$<<228.0*5=1140.0>>1140.0.",
