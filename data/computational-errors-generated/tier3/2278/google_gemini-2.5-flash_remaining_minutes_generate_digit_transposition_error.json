  "flawed_nl_solution": "Johnny spends 6/3=2.0 hours walking the 6 dogs who have 60-minute walks.\nHe makes $20*6=$<<20*6=120>>120 for these walks.\nThus, he has 4-2.0=2.0 hours=210.0 minutes left to walk the other dogs.\nHe can walk 3*(210.0/30)=<<3*(210.0/30)=21.0>>21.0 dogs in this time.\nThus, he will make $15*21.0=$<<21.0*15=315.0>>315.0 on these walks.\nIn total per day, he makes $120+$315.0=$<<120+315.0=435.0>>435.0 per day.\nThus, during the week, he makes $435.0*5=$<<435.0*5=2175.0>>2175.0.",
