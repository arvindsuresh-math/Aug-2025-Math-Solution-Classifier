  "flawed_nl_solution": "Johnny spends 6/3=2 hours walking the 6 dogs who have 60-minute walks.\nHe makes $20*6=$<<20*6=120>>120 for these walks.\nThus, he has 4-2=2 hours=120 minutes left to walk the other dogs.\nHe can walk 3*(120/30)=<<3*(120/30)=12>>12 dogs in this time.\nThus, he will make $15*12=$<<12*15=180>>180 on these walks.\nIn total per day, he makes $120+$180=$<<120+180=303>>303 per day.\nThus, during the week, he makes $303*5=$<<303*5=1515>>1515.\n#### 1515",
