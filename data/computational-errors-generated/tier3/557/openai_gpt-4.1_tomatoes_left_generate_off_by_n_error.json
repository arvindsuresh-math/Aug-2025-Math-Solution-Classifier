  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of tomatoes harvested: 18 plants * 7 tomatoes/plant = <<18*7=126>>126 tomatoes\nThen divide that number by 2 to find how many tomatoes are left undried: 126 tomatoes / 2 = <<126/2=63.0>>63.0 tomatoes\nThen divide that number by 3 to find how many tomatoes are turned into sauce: 63.0 tomatoes / 3 = <<63.0/3=21.0>>21.0 tomatoes\nThen subtract that number from the number of undried tomatoes to find the remaining number of tomatoes: 63.0 tomatoes - 21.0 tomatoes = <<63.0-21.0=46.0>>46.0 tomatoes",
