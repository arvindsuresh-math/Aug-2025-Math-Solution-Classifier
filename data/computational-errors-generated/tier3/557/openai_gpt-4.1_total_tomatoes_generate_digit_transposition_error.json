  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of tomatoes harvested: 18 plants * 7 tomatoes/plant = <<18*7=216>>216 tomatoes\nThen divide that number by 2 to find how many tomatoes are left undried: 216 tomatoes / 2 = <<216/2=108.0>>108.0 tomatoes\nThen divide that number by 3 to find how many tomatoes are turned into sauce: 108.0 tomatoes / 3 = <<108.0/3=36.0>>36.0 tomatoes\nThen subtract that number from the number of undried tomatoes to find the remaining number of tomatoes: 108.0 tomatoes - 36.0 tomatoes = <<108.0-36.0=72.0>>72.0 tomatoes",
