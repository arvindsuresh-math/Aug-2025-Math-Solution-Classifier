  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of tomatoes harvested: 18 plants * 7 tomatoes/plant = <<18*7=126>>126 tomatoes\nThen divide that number by 2 to find how many tomatoes are left undried: 126 tomatoes / 2 = <<126/2=63.0>>63.0 tomatoes\nThen divide that number by 3 to find how many tomatoes are turned into sauce: 63.0 tomatoes / 3 = <<63.0/3=12.0>>12.0 tomatoes\nThen subtract that number from the number of undried tomatoes to find the remaining number of tomatoes: 63.0 tomatoes - 12.0 tomatoes = <<63.0-12.0=51.0>>51.0 tomatoes",
