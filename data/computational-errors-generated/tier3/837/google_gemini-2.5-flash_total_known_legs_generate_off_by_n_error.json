  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 2 dog walkers and they each have 2 legs so that's 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 legs\nThe other dog walker is walking 3 dogs that each have 4 legs so that's 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 legs\nThe dog walkers have 4 legs and the other dogs have 12 legs for a total of 4+12 = <<4+12=12>>12 legs\nThere are 36 legs total and 12 belong to the dog walkers and 3 dogs so that leaves 36-12 = <<36-12=24>>24 legs\nDogs have 4 legs and there are 24 legs so Mariel is walking 24/4 = 6 dogs\n#### 6",
