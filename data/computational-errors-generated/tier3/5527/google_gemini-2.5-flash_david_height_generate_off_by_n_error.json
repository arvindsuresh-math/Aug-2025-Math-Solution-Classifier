  "flawed_nl_solution": "Walter fell 4 meters and an additional three times that depth which is 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 meters\nHe fell for a total of 4+12 = <<4+12=16>>16 meters\nThe eighth platform is 16 meters high and the platforms are evenly spaced so each platform is 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 meters high\nDavid was located 4 meters below the 16 meter level which is 16-4 = <<16-4=8>>8 meters high\nEach platform is 2 meters high so 8 meters would mean the 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4th platform\n#### 4",
