  "flawed_nl_solution": "Rose cooked 10 x 9/10 = <<10*9/10=9>>9 kilograms of rice in the morning.\nShe had 10 - 9 = <<10-9=1>>1 kilogram of rice left then.\nOne kilogram is equal to 1 x 1000 = <<1*1000=1000>>1000 grams.\nSo, Rose cooked 1000 x 1/4 = <<1000*1/4=520>>520 grams of rice in the evening.\nTherefore, she has 1000 - 520 = <<1000-520=480>>480 grams of rice left.",
