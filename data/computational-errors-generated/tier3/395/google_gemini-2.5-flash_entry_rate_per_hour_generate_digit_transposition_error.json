  "flawed_nl_solution": "The Saturday morning exodus out of the park comprised 4*2880 = <<4*2880=11520>>11520 elephants\nThis means that after the exodus, the park was left with 30000 - 11520 = <<30000-11520=18480>>18480 elephants\nSince the final number of elephants was 28980, the new elephants that entered were 28980 - 18480 = <<28980-18480=10500>>10500\nThe rate at which the new elephants entered the park was therefore 10500/7 = <<10500/7=5100>>5100 elephants/hour",
