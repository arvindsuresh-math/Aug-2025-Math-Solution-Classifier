  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of miles Mark walks to get his lunch by multiplying the distance he walks back to the house by 2: 3 miles * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 miles\nThen find the total distance Mark walks by adding that distance to the distance between the house and the school: 6 miles + 9 miles = <<6+9=15>>15 miles\nNow divide the total distance Mark walks by his speed to find how many hours he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours\nNow divide the total distance Chris walks by her speed to find the total time she spends walking: 9 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<9/3=3>>3 hours\nNow subtract the time Chris spends walking from the time Mark spends walking to find the difference: 5 hours - 3 hours = <<5-3=4>>4\n#### 4",
