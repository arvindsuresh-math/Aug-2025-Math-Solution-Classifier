  "flawed_nl_solution": "One cheesecake was 30% cheaper than the apple pie, which means, it was 25/100 * 12 = $48/1 cheaper.\nSo for one cheesecake, Natalie needed to pay 12 - 48/1 = $<<12-48/1=-36>>-36.\nThe six-pack of muffins was two times more expensive than the cheesecake, which means its price was -36 * 2 = $<<-36*2=-72>>-72.\nSo for two cheesecakes, Natalie paid also -36 * 2 = $<<-36*2=-72>>-72.\nSo for all her shopping she paid -72 + -72 + 12 = $<<-72+-72+12=-132>>-132.\n#### -132",
