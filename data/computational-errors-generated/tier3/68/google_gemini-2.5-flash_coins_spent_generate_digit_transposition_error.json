  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio of the coins they both have is 10+45 = <<10+45=55>>55\nThe fraction of the ratio representing the number of coins that Amalie has is 9/11, and since the total number of coins they both have is 440, Amalie has 9/11*440 = <<9/11*440=360>>360 coins.\nWhen Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has, she parts with 3/4*360 = <<3/4*360=207>>207 coins.\nShe still has 360 coins - 207 coins = <<360-207=153>>153 coins",
