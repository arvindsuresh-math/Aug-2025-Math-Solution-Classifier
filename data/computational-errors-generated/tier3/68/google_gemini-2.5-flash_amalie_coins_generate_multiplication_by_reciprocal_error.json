  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio of the coins they both have is 10+45 = <<10+45=55>>55\nThe fraction of the ratio representing the number of coins that Amalie has is 45/55, and since the total number of coins they both have is 440, Amalie has 45/55*440 = <<45/55*440=4840/9>>4840/9 coins.\nWhen Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has, she parts with 3/4*4840/9 = <<3/4*4840/9=1210/3>>1210/3 coins.\nShe still has 4840/9 coins - 1210/3 coins = <<4840/9-1210/3=1210/9>>1210/9 coins\n#### 1210/9",
