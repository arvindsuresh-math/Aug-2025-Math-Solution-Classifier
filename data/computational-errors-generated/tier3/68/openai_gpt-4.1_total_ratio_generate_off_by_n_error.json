  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio of the coins they both have is 10+45 = <<10+45=57>>57\nThe fraction of the ratio representing the number of coins that Amalie has is 45/57, and since the total number of coins they both have is 440, Amalie has 45/57*440 = <<45/57*440=6600/19>>6600/19 coins.\nWhen Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has, she parts with 3/4*6600/19 = <<3/4*6600/19=4950/19>>4950/19 coins.\nShe still has 6600/19 coins - 4950/19 coins = <<6600/19-4950/19=1650/19>>1650/19 coins\n#### 1650/19",
