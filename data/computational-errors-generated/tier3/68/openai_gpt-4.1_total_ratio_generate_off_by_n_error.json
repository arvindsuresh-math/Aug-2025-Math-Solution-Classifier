  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio of the coins they both have is 10+45 = <<10+45=54>>54\nThe fraction of the ratio representing the number of coins that Amalie has is 45/54, and since the total number of coins they both have is 440, Amalie has 45/54*440 = <<45/54*440=1100/3>>1100/3 coins.\nWhen Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has, she parts with 3/4*1100/3 = <<3/4*1100/3=275>>275 coins.\nShe still has 1100/3 coins - 275 coins = <<1100/3-275=275/3>>275/3 coins",
