  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio of the coins they both have is 10+45 = <<10+45=59>>59\nThe fraction of the ratio representing the number of coins that Amalie has is 45/59, and since the total number of coins they both have is 440, Amalie has 45/59*440 = <<45/59*440=19800/59>>19800/59 coins.\nWhen Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has, she parts with 3/4*19800/59 = <<3/4*19800/59=14850/59>>14850/59 coins.\nShe still has 19800/59 coins - 14850/59 coins = <<19800/59-14850/59=4950/59>>4950/59 coins",
