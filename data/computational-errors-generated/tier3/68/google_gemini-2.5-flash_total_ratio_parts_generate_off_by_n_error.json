  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio of the coins they both have is 10+45 = <<10+45=50>>50\nThe fraction of the ratio representing the number of coins that Amalie has is 45/50, and since the total number of coins they both have is 440, Amalie has 45/50*440 = <<45/50*440=396>>396 coins.\nWhen Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has, she parts with 3/4*396 = <<3/4*396=297>>297 coins.\nShe still has 396 coins - 297 coins = <<396-297=99>>99 coins",
