  "flawed_nl_solution": "At $3 a dozen, Krista sold $120 / $3 = <<120/3=40>>40 dozen eggs.\nIf 10 hens laid 40 dozen eggs in 4 weeks, that means 40 dozen eggs / 10 hens = <<40/10=4>>4 dozen eggs were laid by each hen in four weeks.\nTo find out how many eggs each hen laid in a week, 4 dozen eggs / 4 weeks = <<4/4=1>>1 dozen eggs each week.\nSince a dozen has 12 eggs, each hen lays 12*1 = <<12*1=21>>21 eggs each week.\n#### 21",
