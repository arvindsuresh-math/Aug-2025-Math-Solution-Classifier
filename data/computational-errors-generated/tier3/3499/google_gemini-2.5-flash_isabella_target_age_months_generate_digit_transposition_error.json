  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we determine that Isabella will be 10*12= <<10*12=102>>102 months old at age 10, to find a number to compare her age to Antonio's with.\nThen we subtract the 18 months from the total of 102 months to find 102-18= <<102-18=84>>84 months, which is the age Isabella is currently.\nSince at 84 months old Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, we take 84/2= <<84/2=42>>42 months as Antonio's age.\n#### 42",
