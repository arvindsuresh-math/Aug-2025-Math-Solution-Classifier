  "flawed_nl_solution": "We know that 7-1=6 days the paper weighs 8 ounces\nSo those contribute 6*8=<<6*8=48>>48 ounces per week\nSo in total a weekly delivery of papers weighs 48+16=<<48+16=64>>64 ounces\nThat means it weighs 64/16=<<64/16=4>>4 pounds\nSo each week he delivers 4*250=<<4*250=1000>>1000 pounds of paper\nSo in 10, he delivers 1000*10=<<1000*10=10000>>10000 pounds of paper\nThat weighs 10000/2000=<<10000/2000=5>>5 tons of paper\nSo he makes 5*20=$5*20=10>>10 from recycling the paper\n#### 10",
