  "flawed_nl_solution": "The five numbers add up to 10, so the first three numbers add up to 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2.\nThe third number is 0, so the first two numbers add up to 2 - 0 = <<2-0=2>>2.\nThe first and second numbers are equal, so they are both 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1.0>>1.0.\nThe fourth number is double the first number, so it is 2 * 1.0 = <<1.0*2=2.0>>2.0.\nThe fifth number is 8 - 2.0 = <<8-2.0=8.0>>8.0.\nThus, Brad's zip code is 1.01.002.08.0.",
