  "flawed_nl_solution": "The five numbers add up to 10, so the first three numbers add up to 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2.\nThe third number is 0, so the first two numbers add up to 2 - 0 = <<2-0=6>>6.\nThe first and second numbers are equal, so they are both 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3.0>>3.0.\nThe fourth number is double the first number, so it is 2 * 3.0 = <<3.0*2=6.0>>6.0.\nThe fifth number is 8 - 6.0 = <<8-6.0=2.0>>2.0.\nThus, Brad's zip code is 3.03.006.02.0.",
