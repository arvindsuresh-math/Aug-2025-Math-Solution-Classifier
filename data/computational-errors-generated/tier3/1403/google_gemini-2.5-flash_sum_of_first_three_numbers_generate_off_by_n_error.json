  "flawed_nl_solution": "The five numbers add up to 10, so the first three numbers add up to 10 - 8 = <<10-8=4>>4.\nThe third number is 0, so the first two numbers add up to 4 - 0 = <<4-0=4>>4.\nThe first and second numbers are equal, so they are both 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2.\nThe fourth number is double the first number, so it is 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nThe fifth number is 8 - 4 = <<8-4=4>>4.\nThus, Brad's zip code is 22044.\n#### 22044",
