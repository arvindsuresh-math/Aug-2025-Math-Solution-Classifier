  "flawed_nl_solution": "When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24\nThe total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = <<60+24=84>>84\nIf Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 frisbees.\nIf Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = <<2/5*30=75>>75 more frisbees.\nThe total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+75 = <<30+75=105>>105\nBella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = <<20-10=10>>10 deck cards\nIf she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = <<2/5*10=4>>4 more deck cards.\nThe total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = <<10+4=14>>14\nTogether, Bella will have a total of 14+105+84 = <<14+105+84=203>>203 items\n#### 203",
