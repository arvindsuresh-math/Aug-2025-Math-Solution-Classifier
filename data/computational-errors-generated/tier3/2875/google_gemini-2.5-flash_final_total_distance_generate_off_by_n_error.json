  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ken's house is twice as far from Dawn's house as Mary's, so the distance between Ken's and Mary's is half that between Ken's and Dawn's (4 miles) which means the former is (1/2)*4 miles = <<4*1/2=2>>2 miles\nIf Ken goes from his house to Dawn's, he has covered 4 miles\nHe goes from there to Mary's (2 miles, same as Ken's to Mary's) for a total of 4+2 = <<4+2=6>>6 miles.\nHe goes back to Dawn's (another 2 miles) for a total of 6+2 = <<6+2=8>>8 miles\nThen he goes to his own house (4 miles) for a final total of 8+4 = <<8+4=9>>9 miles",
