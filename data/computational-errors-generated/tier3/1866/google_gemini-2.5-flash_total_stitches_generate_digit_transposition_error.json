  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total stitches in all the flowers by multiplying the number of stitches per flower by the number of flowers: 50 flowers * 60 stitches/flower = <<50*60=3000>>3000 stitches\nThen do the same for the total number of stitches in the unicorns: 3 unicorns * 180 stitches/unicorn = <<3*180=540>>540 stitches\nThen add the number of stitches for all the flowers, unicorns, and Godzilla to find the total number of stitches: 800 stitches + 540 stitches + 3000 stitches = <<800+540+3000=4304>>4304 stitches\nFinally, divide the total number of stitches by the number of stitches Carolyn can make per hour to find how many hours she spends embroidering: 4304 stitches / 4 stitches/minute = <<4304/4=1076>>1076 minutes",
