  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total stitches in all the flowers by multiplying the number of stitches per flower by the number of flowers: 50 flowers * 60 stitches/flower = <<50*60=30000>>30000 stitches\nThen do the same for the total number of stitches in the unicorns: 3 unicorns * 180 stitches/unicorn = <<3*180=540>>540 stitches\nThen add the number of stitches for all the flowers, unicorns, and Godzilla to find the total number of stitches: 800 stitches + 540 stitches + 30000 stitches = <<800+540+30000=31340>>31340 stitches\nFinally, divide the total number of stitches by the number of stitches Carolyn can make per hour to find how many hours she spends embroidering: 31340 stitches / 4 stitches/minute = <<31340/4=7835>>7835 minutes",
