  "flawed_nl_solution": "The school bought 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 dinosaur models for the elementary library.\nSo the school bought a total of 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 models.\nThe price of each model was reduced by $100 x 5/100 = $<<100*5/100=2000/1>>2000/1.\nThus, each model cost $100 - $2000/1 = $<<100-2000/1=-1900>>-1900.\nTherefore, the school paid a total of $-1900 x 6 = $<<-1900*6=-11400>>-11400.\n#### -11400",
