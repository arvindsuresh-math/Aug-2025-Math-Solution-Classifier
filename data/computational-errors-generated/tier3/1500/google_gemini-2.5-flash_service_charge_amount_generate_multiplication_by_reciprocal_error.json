  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total amount spent on food is $40 + $15 + $25 = $<<40+15+25=80>>80.\nThe service charge is $80 x 1/10 = $<<80*1/10=800>>800.\nThe tip is $80 x 1/20 = $<<80*1/20=4>>4.\nSo, Mr. Arevalo had to pay $80 + $800 + $4 = $<<80+800+4=884>>884 in all.\nTherefore, his change will only be $100 - $884 = $<<100-884=-784>>-784.",
