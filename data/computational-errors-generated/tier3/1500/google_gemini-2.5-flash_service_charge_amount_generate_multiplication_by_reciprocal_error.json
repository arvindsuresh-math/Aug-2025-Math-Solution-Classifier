  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total amount spent on food is $40 + $15 + $25 = $<<40+15+25=80>>80.\nThe service charge is $80 x 10/100 = $<<80*10/100=800/1>>800/1.\nThe tip is $80 x 5/100 = $<<80*5/100=4>>4.\nSo, Mr. Arevalo had to pay $80 + $800/1 + $4 = $<<80+800/1+4=884>>884 in all.\nTherefore, his change will only be $100 - $884 = $<<100-884=-784>>-784.",
