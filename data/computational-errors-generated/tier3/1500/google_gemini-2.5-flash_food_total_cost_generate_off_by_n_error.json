  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total amount spent on food is $40 + $15 + $25 = $<<40+15+25=78>>78.\nThe service charge is $78 x 10/100 = $<<78*10/100=39/5>>39/5.\nThe tip is $78 x 5/100 = $<<78*5/100=39/10>>39/10.\nSo, Mr. Arevalo had to pay $78 + $39/5 + $39/10 = $<<78+39/5+39/10=897/10>>897/10 in all.\nTherefore, his change will only be $100 - $897/10 = $<<100-897/10=103/10>>103/10.\n#### 103/10",
