  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, find the total number of blocks south Janet is from her starting point by subtracting the blocks she walked north from the blocks she walked south: 8 blocks - 3 blocks = <<8-3=1>>1 blocks\nThen find the number blocks she walked west: 3 blocks * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 blocks\nThen find the number of blocks she walked east: 8 blocks * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 blocks\nSubtract the number of blocks she walked east from the number of blocks she walked west to find how many blocks west of her starting point she is: 21 blocks - 16 blocks = <<21-16=5>>5 blocks\nAdd the number of blocks she needs to walk north to the number of blocks she needs to walk east: 1 blocks + 5 blocks = <<1+5=6>>6 blocks\nFinally, divide the distance she needs to walk by her speed to find how long she'll spend walking: 6 blocks / 2 blocks/minute = <<6/2=3>>3 minutes\n#### 3",
