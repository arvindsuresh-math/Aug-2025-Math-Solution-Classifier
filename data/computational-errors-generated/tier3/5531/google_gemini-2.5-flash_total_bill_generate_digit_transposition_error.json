  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total cost of the hospital bed by multiplying the cost per day by the number of days: $900/day * 3 days = $<<900*3=2700>>2700\nThen figure out how many minutes total the two specialists looked at Dakota: 15 minutes/specialist * 2 specialists = 30 minutes\nThen divide the number of minutes by the number of minutes per hour and multiply it by the specialists' hourly rate to find their total charge: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour * $250/hour = $<<30/60*250=125>>125\nFinally, add up the cost of the specialists, ambulance and bed to find Dakota's total bill: $2700 + $1800 + $125 = $<<2700+1800+125=4652>>4652\n#### 4652",
