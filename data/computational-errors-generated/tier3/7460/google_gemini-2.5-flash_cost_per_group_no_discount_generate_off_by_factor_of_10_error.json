  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ten seats amount to $30 x 10 = $<<30*10=3000>>3000.\nSo there is $3000 x 10/100 = $<<3000*10/100=300>>300 discount for each 10 seats purchased.\nThus, the total cost for every 10 seats is $3000 - $300 = $<<3000-300=2700>>2700.\nThe school is going to buy 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 seats.\nThis means that the school is going to buy 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 sets of 10 seats.\nTherefore, the school will pay a total of $2700 x 4 = $<<2700*4=10800>>10800 for the new seats\n#### 10800",
