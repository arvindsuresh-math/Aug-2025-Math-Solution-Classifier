  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ten seats amount to $30 x 10 = $<<30*10=30>>30.\nSo there is $30 x 10/100 = $<<30*10/100=3>>3 discount for each 10 seats purchased.\nThus, the total cost for every 10 seats is $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27.\nThe school is going to buy 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 seats.\nThis means that the school is going to buy 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 sets of 10 seats.\nTherefore, the school will pay a total of $27 x 4 = $<<27*4=108>>108 for the new seats\n#### 108",
