  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ten seats amount to $30 x 10 = $<<30*10=300>>300.\nSo there is $300 x 10/100 = $<<300*10/100=30>>30 discount for each 10 seats purchased.\nThus, the total cost for every 10 seats is $300 - $30 = $<<300-30=270>>270.\nThe school is going to buy 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 seats.\nThis means that the school is going to buy 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 sets of 10 seats.\nTherefore, the school will pay a total of $270 x 4 = $<<270*4=1800>>1800 for the new seats\n#### 1800",
