  "flawed_nl_solution": "On Monday, Jake watched 24 hours / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 hours.\nOn Wednesday, he watched 24 hours / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 hours.\nSo from Monday to Wednesday, he watched a total of 12 Monday hours + 4 Tuesday hours + 6 Wednesday hours = <<12+4+6=18>>18 hours.\nHe watched half of this on Thursday, which is 18 hours / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 hours.\nSo from Monday to Thursday, he watched 18 + 9 = <<18+9=27>>27 hours.\nTo finish the show on Friday, he must have therefore watched 52 - 27 = <<52-27=25>>25 hours.\n#### 25",
