  "flawed_nl_solution": "On Monday, Jake watched 24 hours / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 hours.\nOn Wednesday, he watched 24 hours / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 hours.\nSo from Monday to Wednesday, he watched a total of 12 Monday hours + 4 Tuesday hours + 6 Wednesday hours = <<12+4+6=22>>22 hours.\nHe watched half of this on Thursday, which is 22 hours / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 hours.\nSo from Monday to Thursday, he watched 22 + 11 = <<22+11=33>>33 hours.\nTo finish the show on Friday, he must have therefore watched 52 - 33 = <<52-33=14>>14 hours.\n#### 14",
