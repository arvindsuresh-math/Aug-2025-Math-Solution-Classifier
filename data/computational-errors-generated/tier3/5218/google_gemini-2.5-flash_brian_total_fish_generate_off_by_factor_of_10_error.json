  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Brian caught 400 fish in one trip, he caught 2*400=<<400*2=800>>800 fish in two trips.\nSince Brian catches 2/5 times less fish than Chris per trip, Chris catches 2/5*400=<<2/5*400=160>>160 more fish in one fishing trip.\nChris's total number of fish in one trip is 400+160 = <<400+160=560>>560 fish.\nIn 10 trips, Chris catches 560*10=<<560*10=5600>>5600 fish.\nIf in his two trips Brian catches 800 fish, and he goes fishing twice as often as Chris, if Chris goes fishing 10 times, Brian will catch 800*10=<<800*10=80000>>80000 fish.\nThe total number of fish they'll catch if Chris goes fishing ten times is 80000+5600=<<80000+5600=85600>>85600\n#### 85600",
