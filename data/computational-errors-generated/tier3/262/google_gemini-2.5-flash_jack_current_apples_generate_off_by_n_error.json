  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's, and Jack's is capable of holding 12 apples in total, this means Jill's basket can hold 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 apples in total.\nSince Jack has 4 less than the maximum amount of apples he can fit in his basket, this means Jack has 12-4= <<12-4=6>>6 apples in his basket.\nTherefore, Jill's basket can hold 24/6= <<24/6=4.0>>4.0 times the amount of apples Jack is currently carrying.",
