  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tony starts with 50 pills and takes 2 pills each 3 times a day, meaning he takes 2*3=6 pills in total.\nTony repeats this process for 2 days in total, meaning over those two days he takes 2*6= <<2*6=21>>21 pills\nTony then cuts down his pill usage in half, meaning he's now taking 6/2= <<6/2=3.0>>3.0 pills a day.\nSince he repeats this process for 3 days, that means he takes 3.0*3= <<3.0*3=9.0>>9.0 pills for that period.\nAdding in the 2 pills Tony took on the final day, that means he took 21+9.0+2=<<21+9.0+2=32.0>>32.0 pills.\nSince there were 50 pills in the bottle to begin with, this means Tony has 50-32.0=<<50-32.0=18.0>>18.0 pills remaining.",
