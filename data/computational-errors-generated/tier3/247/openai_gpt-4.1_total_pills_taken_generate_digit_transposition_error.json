  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tony starts with 50 pills and takes 2 pills each 3 times a day, meaning he takes 2*3=6 pills in total.\nTony repeats this process for 2 days in total, meaning over those two days he takes 2*6= <<2*6=12>>12 pills\nTony then cuts down his pill usage in half, meaning he's now taking 6/2= <<6/2=3>>3 pills a day.\nSince he repeats this process for 3 days, that means he takes 3*3= <<3*3=9>>9 pills for that period.\nAdding in the 2 pills Tony took on the final day, that means he took 12+9+2=<<12+9+2=32>>32 pills.\nSince there were 50 pills in the bottle to begin with, this means Tony has 50-32=<<50-32=18>>18 pills remaining.\n#### 18",
