  "flawed_nl_solution": "If a cow drinks 80 liters of water in a day, it drinks 80*7= <<80*7=650>>650 liters of water per week.\nMr. Reyansh has 40 cows drinking 650 liters of water a week, totaling 650*40 = <<650*40=26000>>26000 liters.\nIn the ranch, a sheep drinks 1/4*80 = <<80*1/4=20>>20 liters of water in a day.\nThe total amount of liters a sheep drinks in a week is 20*7 = <<20*7=140>>140 liters\nMr. Reyansh has 10 times as many sheep as cows, that is 10*40 = <<10*40=400>>400 sheep.\nIf each sheep drinks 140 liters of water in a week, 400 sheep drinks 400*140 = <<400*140=56000>>56000 liters of water.\nTogether, the cows and sheep drink 56000+26000 = <<56000+26000=82000>>82000 liters of water per week.\n#### 82000",
