  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 4/5 * 10 = <<4/5*10=25/2>>25/2 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.\nSo in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 25/2 = <<10+25/2=45/2>>45/2 purple flowers.\nPurple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 45/2 = <<10+45/2=65/2>>65/2 flowers.\nThat means in Mark's garden there are 1/4 * 65/2 = <<1/4*65/2=65/8>>65/8 green flowers.\nSo in total Mark has 65/2 + 65/8 = <<65/2+65/8=325/8>>325/8 plants in his garden.",
