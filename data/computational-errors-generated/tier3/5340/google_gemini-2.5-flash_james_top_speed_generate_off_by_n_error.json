  "flawed_nl_solution": "John runs 100-4=<<100-4=96>>96 meters once he reaches his max speed\nHe runs it in 13-1=<<13-1=12>>12 seconds\nSo he runs at a speed of 96/12=<<96/12=8>>8 m/s\nSo that means James's top speed is 8+2=<<8+2=6>>6 m/s\nHe has to run 100-10=<<100-10=90>>90 meters at his top speed\nSo he runs that at 90/6=<<90/6=15>>15 seconds\nSo he takes 15+2=<<15+2=17>>17 seconds to run 100 meters\n#### 17",
