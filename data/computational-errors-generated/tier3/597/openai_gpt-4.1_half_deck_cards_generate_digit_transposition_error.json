  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the full decks, John has a total of 52 cards in a full deck of cards * 3 full decks of cards = <<52*3=156>>156 cards.\nA half-full deck of cards contains 52 cards in a full deck of cards / 2 = <<52/2=62.0>>62.0 cards.\nSo from the half-full decks, John has a total of 62.0 cards * 3 half-full decks = <<62.0*3=186.0>>186.0 cards.\nThis is a total of 156 cards from full decks + 186.0 cards from half-full decks = <<156+186.0=342.0>>342.0 cards.\nAfter throwing some in the trash, he now holds a total of 342.0 cards - 34 trashed cards = <<342.0-34=308.0>>308.0 cards.",
