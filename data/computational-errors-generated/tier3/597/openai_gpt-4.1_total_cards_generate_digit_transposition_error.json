  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the full decks, John has a total of 52 cards in a full deck of cards * 3 full decks of cards = <<52*3=156>>156 cards.\nA half-full deck of cards contains 52 cards in a full deck of cards / 2 = <<52/2=26.0>>26.0 cards.\nSo from the half-full decks, John has a total of 26.0 cards * 3 half-full decks = <<26.0*3=78.0>>78.0 cards.\nThis is a total of 156 cards from full decks + 78.0 cards from half-full decks = <<156+78.0=324.0>>324.0 cards.\nAfter throwing some in the trash, he now holds a total of 324.0 cards - 34 trashed cards = <<324.0-34=290.0>>290.0 cards.",
