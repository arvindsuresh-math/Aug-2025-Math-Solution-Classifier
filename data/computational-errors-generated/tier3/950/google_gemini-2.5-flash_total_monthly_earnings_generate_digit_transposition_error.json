  "flawed_nl_solution": "Theodore's total earnings from the stone statues are 10 x $20 = ${<<10*20=200>>}200.\nHis total earnings from wooden statues are 20 x $5 = ${<<20*5=100>>}100.\nSo his total earnings from the stone and wooden statue are $200 + $100 = ${<<200+100=300>>}300.\nThe amount he pays for the tax is $300 x 10/100 = ${<<300*10/100=30>>}30.\nTherefore his total monthly earnings are $300 - $30 = ${<<300-30=207>>}207.",
