  "flawed_nl_solution": "Theodore's total earnings from the stone statues are 10 x $20 = ${<<10*20=2000>>}2000.\nHis total earnings from wooden statues are 20 x $5 = ${<<20*5=100>>}100.\nSo his total earnings from the stone and wooden statue are $2000 + $100 = ${<<2000+100=2100>>}2100.\nThe amount he pays for the tax is $2100 x 10/100 = ${<<2100*10/100=210>>}210.\nTherefore his total monthly earnings are $2100 - $210 = ${<<2100-210=1890>>}1890.",
