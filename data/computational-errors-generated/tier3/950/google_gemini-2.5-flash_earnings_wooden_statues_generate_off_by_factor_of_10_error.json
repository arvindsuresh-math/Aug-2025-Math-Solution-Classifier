  "flawed_nl_solution": "Theodore's total earnings from the stone statues are 10 x $20 = ${<<10*20=200>>}200.\nHis total earnings from wooden statues are 20 x $5 = ${<<20*5=1000>>}1000.\nSo his total earnings from the stone and wooden statue are $200 + $1000 = ${<<200+1000=1200>>}1200.\nThe amount he pays for the tax is $1200 x 10/100 = ${<<1200*10/100=120>>}120.\nTherefore his total monthly earnings are $1200 - $120 = ${<<1200-120=1080>>}1080.",
