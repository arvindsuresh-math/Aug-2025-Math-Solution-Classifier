  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jessica will drive 20 minutes, twice every school day (to and from school), so 20 minutes x 2 trips = <<20*2=40>>40 minutes each day.\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 50 hours of driving x 60 minutes/hour = <<50*60=3000>>3000 minutes.\nIf you take the 3000 minutes she needs to drive / 40 minutes driving each day = <<3000/40=57.0>>57.0 school days to drive 50 hours.",
