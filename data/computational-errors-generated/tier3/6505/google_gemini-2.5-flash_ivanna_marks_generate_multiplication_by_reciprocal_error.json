  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Dorothy scored 90 marks, and Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks, Ivanna scored 3/5*90 = <<90*3/5=450/3>>450/3 marks.\nTogether, Dorothy and Ivanna scored a total of 450/3+90 = <<450/3+90=240>>240 marks.\nIf Tayuta scored twice as many marks as Ivanna, she scored 2*450/3 = <<2*450/3=300>>300 marks.\nThe total marks the three scored altogether is 300+240 = <<300+240=540>>540 marks.\nThe average marks for the three are 540/3 = <<540/3=180>>180 marks.\n#### 180",
