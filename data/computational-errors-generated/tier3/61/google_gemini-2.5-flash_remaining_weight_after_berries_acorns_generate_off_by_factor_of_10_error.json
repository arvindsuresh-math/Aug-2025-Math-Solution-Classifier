  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bear gained 1 / 5 * 1000 = <<1/5*1000=200.0>>200.0 pounds from berries.\nIt gained 2 * 200.0 = <<2*200.0=400.0>>400.0 pounds from acorns.\nIt still needed 1000 - 200.0 - 400.0 = <<1000-200.0-400.0=4000.0>>4000.0 pounds.\nThus, it gained 4000.0 / 2 = <<4000.0/2=2000.0>>2000.0 pounds from salmon.\nTherefore, the bear gained 4000.0 - 2000.0 = <<4000.0-2000.0=2000.0>>2000.0 pounds from small animals.",
