  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bear gained 1/5 * 1000 = <<1/5*1000=200>>200 pounds from berries.\nIt gained 2 * 200 = <<2*200=400>>400 pounds from acorns.\nIt still needed 1000 - 200 - 400 = <<1000-200-400=4000>>4000 pounds.\nThus, it gained 4000 / 2 = <<4000/2=2000>>2000 pounds from salmon.\nTherefore, the bear gained 4000 - 2000 = <<4000-2000=2000>>2000 pounds from small animals.",
