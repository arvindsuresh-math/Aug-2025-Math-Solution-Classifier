  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bear gained 1 / 5 * 1000 = <<1/5*1000=200>>200 pounds from berries.\nIt gained 2 * 200 = <<2*200=400>>400 pounds from acorns.\nIt still needed 1000 - 200 - 400 = <<1000-200-400=396>>396 pounds.\nThus, it gained 396 / 2 = <<396/2=198>>198 pounds from salmon.\nTherefore, the bear gained 396 - 198 = <<396-198=198>>198 pounds from small animals.",
