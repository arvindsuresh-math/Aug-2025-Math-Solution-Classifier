  "flawed_nl_solution": "Justin would spend 45 minutes at dinner, 30 minutes doing homework, 30 minutes cleaning his room, 5 minutes on the trash and 10 on dishes for a total of 45+30+30+5+10 = <<45+30+30+5+10=120>>120\nJustin knows that 60min is the same as 1 hour. He has 120 minutes of work so 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours\nHis movie comes on at 8 pm and he has 2 hours of chores so 8-2 = <<8-2=10>>10 pm is the latest time he could start his chores\n#### 10",
