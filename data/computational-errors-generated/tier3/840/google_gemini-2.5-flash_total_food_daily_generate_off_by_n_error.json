  "flawed_nl_solution": "Eating three times a day, a dog eats 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 pounds of food.\nSince there are 3 dogs at the camp, the total amount of food they eat is 3*12=<<3*12=36>>36 pounds of food in a day.\nIf each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, a puppy will eat 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 pounds of food in one meal.\nEach puppy eats three times as often as a dog, and if a dog eats three times in a day, a puppy will eat 3*3= <<3*3=9>>9 times in a day.\nSince a puppy eats 2 pounds of food a day, the total amount of food a puppy will eat in a day is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 pounds of food.\nFour puppies in the camp eat 18*4=<<18*4=72>>72 pounds of food every day.\nTogether, the dogs and the puppies eat 72+36=<<72+36=104>>104 pounds of food in a day.",
