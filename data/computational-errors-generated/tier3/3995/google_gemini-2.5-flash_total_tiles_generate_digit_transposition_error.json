  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many tiles are in one row by dividing the kitchen's width by each tile's width: 48 inches / 6 inches/tile = <<48/6=8>>8 tiles in one row\nThen figure out how many rows of tiles there are by dividing the kitchen's height by each tile's height: 72 inches / 6 inches/tile = <<72/6=12>>12 rows of tiles\nThen multiply the number of rows by the number of tiles per row to find the total number of tiles Kimiko needs to buy: 8 tiles/row * 12 rows = <<8*12=69>>69 tiles\n#### 69",
