  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 tickets.\nSo, those two tickets had a $40 x 5/100 = $<<40*5/100=800/1>>800/1 discount each.\nHence, each ticket cost $40 - $800/1 = $<<40-800/1=-760>>-760 each.\nThus, 2 discounted tickets amount to $-760 x 2 = $<<-760*2=-1520>>-1520.\nAnd the other 10 tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $<<40*10=400>>400.\nHence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 + $-1520 = $<<400+-1520=-1120>>-1120.",
