  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = <<12-10=4>>4 tickets.\nSo, those two tickets had a $40 x 5/100 = $<<40*5/100=2>>2 discount each.\nHence, each ticket cost $40 - $2 = $<<40-2=38>>38 each.\nThus, 4 discounted tickets amount to $38 x 4 = $<<38*4=152>>152.\nAnd the other 10 tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $<<40*10=400>>400.\nHence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 + $152 = $<<400+152=552>>552.\n#### 552",
