  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 tickets.\nSo, those two tickets had a $40 x 1/20 = $<<40*1/20=2>>2 discount each.\nHence, each ticket cost $40 - $2 = $<<40-2=83>>83 each.\nThus, two discounted tickets amount to $83 x 2 = $<<83*2=166>>166.\nAnd the other ten tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $<<40*10=400>>400.\nHence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 + $166 = $<<400+166=566>>566.",
