  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 tickets.\nSo, those two tickets had a $40 x 1/20 = $<<40*1/20=2>>2 discount each.\nHence, each ticket cost $40 - $2 = $<<40-2=38>>38 each.\nThus, 2 discounted tickets amount to $38 x 2 = $<<38*2=76>>76.\nAnd the other 10 tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $<<40*10=400>>400.\nHence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 + $76 = $<<400+76=467>>467.",
