  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 tickets.\nSo, those two tickets had a $40 x 5/100 = $<<40*5/100=2>>2 discount each.\nHence, each ticket cost $40 - $2 = $<<40-2=38>>38 each.\nThus, two discounted tickets amount to $38 x 2 = $<<38*2=76>>76.\nAnd the other ten tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $<<40*10=40>>40.\nHence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $40 + $76 = $<<40+76=116>>116.\n#### 116",
