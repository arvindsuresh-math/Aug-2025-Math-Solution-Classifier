  "flawed_nl_solution": "Greta the goose eats 20/10=<<20/10=2>>2 pounds of food per day.\nMilton the mouse eats (1/100)*2=200 of a pound of food per day.\nElmer the elephant eats 4000*(200)=<<4000*(200)=800000>>800000 pounds of food per day.\nThus, Elmer eats 800000-20=799980 pounds more food per day than does Penelope the pig.",
