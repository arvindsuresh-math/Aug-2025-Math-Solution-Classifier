  "flawed_nl_solution": "When Luisa takes out 2 apples from the bag, 7 apples - 2 apples = <<7-2=3>>3 apples remain in the bag.\nShe also takes 2 apples * 2 oranges/apple = <<2*2=4>>4 oranges from the bag.\nThe total number of oranges remaining in the bag is 8 oranges - 4 oranges = <<8-4=4>>4 oranges\nAdditionally, a total of 2/3 * 15 mangoes = <<2/3*15=10>>10 mangoes are also removed from the bag.\nThe total number of mangoes remaining in the bag is 15 mangoes - 10 mangoes = <<15-10=5>>5 mangoes.\nThe total number of fruits that Luisa left in the bag is 3 apples + 4 oranges + 5 mangoes = <<3+4+5=12>>12\n#### 12",
