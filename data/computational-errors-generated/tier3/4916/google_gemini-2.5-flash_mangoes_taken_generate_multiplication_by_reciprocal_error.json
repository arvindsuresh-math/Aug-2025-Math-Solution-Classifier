  "flawed_nl_solution": "When Luisa takes out 2 apples from the bag, 7 apples - 2 apples = <<7-2=5>>5 apples remain in the bag.\nShe also takes 2 apples * 2 oranges/apple = <<2*2=4>>4 oranges from the bag.\nThe total number of oranges remaining in the bag is 8 oranges - 4 oranges = <<8-4=4>>4 oranges\nAdditionally, a total of 2/3 * 15 mangoes = <<2/3*15=45/2>>45/2 mangoes are also removed from the bag.\nThe total number of mangoes remaining in the bag is 15 mangoes - 45/2 mangoes = <<15-45/2=-15/2>>-15/2 mangoes.\nThe total number of fruits that Luisa left in the bag is 5 apples + 4 oranges + -15/2 mangoes = <<5+4+-15/2=3/2>>3/2\n#### 3/2",
