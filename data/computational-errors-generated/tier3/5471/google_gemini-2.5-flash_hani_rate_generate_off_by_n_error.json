  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Diana did 40 situps at a rate of 4 situps/minute, she did situps for 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 minutes\nHani had to do 3 + 4 = <<3+4=5>>5 situps per minute if Diana did 4 situps per minute.\nSo over the 10 minutes Hani did 5*10 = <<5*10=50>>50 situps.\nTogether, the total number of situps they did is 50+40 = <<50+40=90>>90\n#### 90",
