  "flawed_nl_solution": "Alex gives his friends a total of 5 friends * 20 meters of silk = <<5*20=100>>100 meters of silk.\nThis means he has 600 - 100 = <<600-100=470>>470 meters of silk left in storage.\nHe can therefore make 470 meters of silk / 5 meters of silk per dress = <<470/5=94>>94 dresses.\n#### 94",
