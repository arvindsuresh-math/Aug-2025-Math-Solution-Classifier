  "flawed_nl_solution": "Andrea sold 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 tickets.\nHalf the number of tickets Jude sold is 16/2 = <<16/2=8.0>>8.0.\nSo, Sandra sold 8.0 + 4 = <<8.0+4=12.0>>12.0 tickets.\nThus, Andrea, Jude, and Sandra sold a total of 32 + 16 + 12.0 = <<32+16+12.0=60.0>>60.0 tickets.\nTherefore, 100 - 60.0 = <<100-60.0=41.0>>41.0 tickets need to be sold.",
