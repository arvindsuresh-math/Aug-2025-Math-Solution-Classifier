  "flawed_nl_solution": "Andrea sold 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 tickets.\nHalf the number of tickets Jude sold is 16/2 = <<16/2=8.0>>8.0.\nSo, Sandra sold 8.0 + 4 = <<8.0+4=21.0>>21.0 tickets.\nThus, Andrea, Jude, and Sandra sold a total of 32 + 16 + 21.0 = <<32+16+21.0=69.0>>69.0 tickets.\nTherefore, 100 - 69.0 = <<100-69.0=31.0>>31.0 tickets need to be sold.",
