  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of gates someone has to pass through: 12 floors / 3 floors/gate = <<12/3=4>>4 gates\nThen find the total time someone spends waiting at the gates: 4 gates * 2 minutes/gate = <<4*2=8>>8 minutes\nThen convert that time to seconds: 8 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<8*60=480>>480 seconds\nThen find the time to drive through one floor in seconds: 800 feet / 10 feet/second = <<800/10=80>>80 seconds\nThen multiply the time per floor by the number of floors to find the total driving time: 80 seconds/floor * 12 floors = 960 seconds\nThen add the total driving time to the total time waiting at the gates to find the total time to get to the bottom: 960 seconds + 480 seconds = <<960+480=1441>>1441 seconds\n#### 1441",
