  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many eggs per minute the owner can clean up: 60 seconds/minute / 15 seconds/egg = <<60/15=4>>4 eggs/minute\nThen divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs cleaned per minute to find how long the owner spends cleaning them up: 60 eggs / 4 eggs/minute = <<60/4=15>>15 minutes\nThen find the total time the owner spends cleaning up toilet paper: 7 rolls * 30 minutes/roll = <<7*30=210>>210 minutes\nFinally, add that amount to the egg cleaning time to find the total cleaning time: 210 minutes + 15 minutes = <<210+15=221>>221 minutes\n#### 221",
