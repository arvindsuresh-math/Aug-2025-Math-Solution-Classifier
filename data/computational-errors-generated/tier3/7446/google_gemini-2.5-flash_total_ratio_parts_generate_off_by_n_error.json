  "flawed_nl_solution": "The students are divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=8>>8 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.\nEach part represents 1000/8 = <<1000/8=125>>125 students.\nSo, there are 3 x 125 = <<3*125=375>>375 males.\nAnd there are 2 x 125 = <<2*125=250>>250 females.\nHence, 375 x 2/3 = 250 males play basketball.\nAnd 250 x 1/5 = <<250*1/5=50>>50 females play basketball.\nA total of 250 + 50 = <<250+50=300>>300 students play basketball.\nTherefore, 1000 - 300 = <<1000-300=700>>700 do not like to play basketball.\nThe percentage of the school that do not like to play basketball is 700/1000 * 100 = <<700/1000*100=70>>70\n#### 70",
