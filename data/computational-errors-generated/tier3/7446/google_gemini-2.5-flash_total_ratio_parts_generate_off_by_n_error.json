  "flawed_nl_solution": "The students are divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=10>>10 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.\nEach part represents 1000/10 = <<1000/10=100>>100 students.\nSo, there are 3 x 100 = <<3*100=300>>300 males.\nAnd there are 2 x 100 = <<2*100=200>>200 females.\nHence, 300 x 2/3 = 200 males play basketball.\nAnd 200 x 1/5 = <<200*1/5=40>>40 females play basketball.\nA total of 200 + 40 = <<200+40=240>>240 students play basketball.\nTherefore, 1000 - 240 = <<1000-240=760>>760 do not like to play basketball.\nThe percentage of the school that do not like to play basketball is 760/1000 * 100 = <<760/1000*100=76>>76\n#### 76",
