  "flawed_nl_solution": "From babysitting Julie, Zoe made 3 * 600 = <<3*600=1080>>1080 dollars, since she made $600 babysitting Zachary and she babysat Julie three times as often\nSince she babysat Zachary 1/5 as often as she babysat Chloe, she made an additional 5 * 600 = <<5*600=3000>>3000 dollars from babysitting Chloe.\nAll together, the babysitting sessions made Zoe 600 + 1080 + 3000 = <<600+1080+3000=4680>>4680 dollars\nSubtracting babysitting payments from the total gives 8000 - 4680 = <<8000-4680=3320>>3320 dollars\n#### 3320",
