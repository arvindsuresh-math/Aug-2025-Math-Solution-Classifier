  "flawed_nl_solution": "If he sold a painting at a 1/10 loss, then he made a 1/10*$40 = $<<1/10*40=4>>4 loss on each painting.\nsince he bought 10 paintings, the total loss he made from selling the paintings is 10*$4 = $<<10*4=40>>40\nHe also made a loss of 3/20*20 = $<<3/20*20=400/3>>400/3 loss from selling each wooden toy.\nSince he bought 8 wooden toys, the total loss he made was 400/3*8 = $<<8*400/3=3200/3>>3200/3\nIn total, Mr. Callen made a loss of $40+$3200/3 = $<<40+3200/3=3320/3>>3320/3 from the sales of the items.",
