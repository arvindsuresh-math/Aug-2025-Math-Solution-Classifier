  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Montero is traveling a total distance of 600 miles + 600 miles = <<600+600=1200>>1200 miles.\nThere are 1200 miles / 400 miles = <<1200/400=3>>3 sets of 400 miles in 1200 miles.\nSo Mr. Montero needs 20 gallons/set x 3 sets = <<20*3=60>>60 gallons in all.\nSince his car has 8 gallons already, then he needs to add 60 gallons - 8 gallons = <<60-8=55>>55 gallons more.\n#### 55",
