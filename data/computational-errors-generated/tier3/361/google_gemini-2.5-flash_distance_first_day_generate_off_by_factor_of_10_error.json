  "flawed_nl_solution": "Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=6000>>6000 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 6000 kilometers, then 2*6000=<<2*6000=12000>>12000 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 12000 = <<12000/3=4000>>4000 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 6000 - 4000 = <<6000-4000=2000>>2000 kilometers.\n#### 2000",
