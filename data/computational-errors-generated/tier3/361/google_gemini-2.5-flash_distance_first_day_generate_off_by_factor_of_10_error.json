  "flawed_nl_solution": "Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=60>>60 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 60 kilometers, then 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 120 = <<120/3=40>>40 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 kilometers.",
