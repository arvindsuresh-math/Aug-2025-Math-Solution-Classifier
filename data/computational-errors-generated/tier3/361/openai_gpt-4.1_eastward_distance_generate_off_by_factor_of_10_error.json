  "flawed_nl_solution": "Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=60>>60 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 60 kilometers, then 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 0.3333333333333333 * 120 = <<120/3=40.0>>40.0 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 60 - 40.0 = <<60-40.0=20.0>>20.0 kilometers.",
