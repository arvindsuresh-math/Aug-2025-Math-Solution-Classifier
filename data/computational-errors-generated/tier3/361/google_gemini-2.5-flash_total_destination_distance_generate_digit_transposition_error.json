  "flawed_nl_solution": "Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 600 kilometers, then 2*600=<<2*600=1020>>1020 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 1020 = <<1020/3=340>>340 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 600 - 340 = <<600-340=260>>260 kilometers.",
