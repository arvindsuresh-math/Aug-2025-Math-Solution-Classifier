  "flawed_nl_solution": "Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 600 kilometers, then 2*600=<<2*600=1200>>1200 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 0.3333333333333333 * 1200 = <<1200/3=40>>40 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 600 - 40 = <<600-40=560>>560 kilometers.",
