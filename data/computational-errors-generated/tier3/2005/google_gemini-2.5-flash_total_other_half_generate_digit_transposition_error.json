  "flawed_nl_solution": "Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends.\nHazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=82>>82 cups.\nSince Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 82 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 82 cups to the construction crew.\nIn all, Hazel sold 82 + 82 = <<82+82=164>>164 cups of lemonade.\n#### 164",
