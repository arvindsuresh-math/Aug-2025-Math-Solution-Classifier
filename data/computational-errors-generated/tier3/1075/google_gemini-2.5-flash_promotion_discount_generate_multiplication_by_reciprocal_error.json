  "flawed_nl_solution": "The flashlight was 1/5 of the price of the hoodie, so 80 * 1/5 = $<<80*1/5=16>>16.\nThe promotion for a pair of boots was 110 * 1/10 = $<<110*1/10=1100>>1100.\nSo the pair of boots cost 110 - 1100 = $<<110-1100=-990>>-990.\nCelina therefore spent 80 + 16 + -990 = $<<80+16+-990=-894>>-894 on the equipment.",
