  "flawed_nl_solution": "The flashlight was 20/100 of the price of the hoodie, so 80 * 20/100 = $<<80*20/100=16>>16.\nThe promotion for a pair of boots was 110 * 10/100 = $<<110*10/100=1100/1>>1100/1.\nSo the pair of boots cost 110 - 1100/1 = $<<110-1100/1=-990>>-990.\nCelina therefore spent 80 + 16 + -990 = $<<80+16+-990=-894>>-894 on the equipment.",
