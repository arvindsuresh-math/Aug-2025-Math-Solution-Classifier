  "flawed_nl_solution": "The flashlight was 20/100 of the price of the hoodie, so 80 * 20/100 = $<<80*20/100=400/1>>400/1.\nThe promotion for a pair of boots was 110 * 10/100 = $<<110*10/100=11>>11.\nSo the pair of boots cost 110 - 11 = $<<110-11=99>>99.\nCelina therefore spent 80 + 400/1 + 99 = $<<80+400/1+99=579>>579 on the equipment.\n#### 579",
