  "flawed_nl_solution": "The flashlight was 1/5 of the price of the hoodie, so 80 * 1/5 = $<<80*1/5=400>>400.\nThe promotion for a pair of boots was 110 * 1/10 = $<<110*1/10=11>>11.\nSo the pair of boots cost 110 - 11 = $<<110-11=99>>99.\nCelina therefore spent 80 + 400 + 99 = $<<80+400+99=579>>579 on the equipment.",
