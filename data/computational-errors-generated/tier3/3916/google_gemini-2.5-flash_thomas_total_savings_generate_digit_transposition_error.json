  "flawed_nl_solution": "Thomas has been saving for 6 years, and since each year has 12 months, he has been making savings for 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 months.\nSince Thomas has been saving $40 in the bank every month for six years, he has saved 72*$40 = $<<72*40=8280>>8280\nJoseph has been saving 2/5 times less money per month than Thomas, meaning he has been saving 2/5*$40 = $<<2/5*40=16>>16 less per month.\nThe total amount of money that Joseph has been saving per month is $40-$16 = $<<40-16=24>>24\nIn six years, Joseph has saved $24*72 = $<<24*72=1728>>1728\nTogether, they have saved a total of $8280+$1728 = $<<8280+1728=10008>>10008\n#### 10008",
