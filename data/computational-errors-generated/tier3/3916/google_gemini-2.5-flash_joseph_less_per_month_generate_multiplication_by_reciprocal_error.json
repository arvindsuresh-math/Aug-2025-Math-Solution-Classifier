  "flawed_nl_solution": "Thomas has been saving for 6 years, and since each year has 12 months, he has been making savings for 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 months.\nSince Thomas has been saving $40 in the bank every month for six years, he has saved 72*$40 = $<<72*40=2880>>2880\nJoseph has been saving 2/5 times less money per month than Thomas, meaning he has been saving 2/5*$40 = $<<2/5*40=200/2>>200/2 less per month.\nThe total amount of money that Joseph has been saving per month is $40-$200/2 = $<<40-200/2=-60>>-60\nIn six years, Joseph has saved $-60*72 = $<<-60*72=-4320>>-4320\nTogether, they have saved a total of $2880+$-4320 = $<<2880+-4320=-1440>>-1440\n#### -1440",
