  "flawed_nl_solution": "The wife saves $100/week x 4 weeks/month = $400 a month.\nTogether, the wife and husband save $400/month + $225/month = $<<400+225=625>>625/month.\nIn 4 months, their total savings is $625/month x 4 months = $<<625*4=2500>>2500.\nThey are going to invest $2500 / 2 = $<<2500/2=1250>>1250.\nSo, they can buy $1250 / $50/share = <<1250/50=52>>52 shares of stocks.\n#### 52",
