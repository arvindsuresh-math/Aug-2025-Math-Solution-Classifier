  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many degrees below 32 the temperature is: 32 degrees - 8 degrees = <<32-8=27>>27 degrees\nThen divide that amount by the number of degrees per 5% increase in skid risk to find how many 5% increases there are: 27 degrees / 3 degrees/5% increase = <<27/3=9>>9 5% increases\nMultiply the number of increases by 5% to find the total increase in skid risk: 9 * 5% = 45%\nNow find the chance that Annie has a serious accident if she goes into a skid by subtracting the chance she regains control from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%\nFinally, multiply the chance of going into a skid by the chance of having a serious accident after a skid to find the total risk of a serious accident: 60% * 45% = 27%\n#### 27",
