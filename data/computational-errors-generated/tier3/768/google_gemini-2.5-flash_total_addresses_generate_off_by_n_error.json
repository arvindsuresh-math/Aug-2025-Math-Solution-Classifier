  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, twice the number that Governor Hawkins gave, Governor Hawkins gave 12/2 = <<12/2=6.0>>6.0 commencement addresses.\nThe two of them gave 6.0+12 = <<6.0+12=18.0>>18.0 commencement addresses in total.\nGovernor Sloan gave 10 more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval, a total of 12+10 = <<12+10=22>>22 commencement addresses.\nThe three of them gave 22+18.0 = <<22+18.0=43.0>>43.0 commencement addresses.",
