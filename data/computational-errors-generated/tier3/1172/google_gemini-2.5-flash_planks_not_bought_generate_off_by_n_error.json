  "flawed_nl_solution": "In Colbert's storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=174>>174 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks - 174 owned wooden planks = <<200-174=26>>26 wooden planks.",
