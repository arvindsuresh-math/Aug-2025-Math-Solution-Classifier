  "flawed_nl_solution": "In Colbert's storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50.0>>50.0 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100.0>>100.0 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50.0 wooden planks from storage + 100.0 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50.0+100.0+20=173.0>>173.0 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks - 173.0 owned wooden planks = <<200-173.0=27.0>>27.0 wooden planks.",
