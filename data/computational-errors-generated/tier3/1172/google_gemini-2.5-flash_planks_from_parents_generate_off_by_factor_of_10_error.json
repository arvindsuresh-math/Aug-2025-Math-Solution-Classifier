  "flawed_nl_solution": "In Colbert's storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50.0>>50.0 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=10.0>>10.0 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50.0 wooden planks from storage + 10.0 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50.0+10.0+20=80.0>>80.0 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks - 80.0 owned wooden planks = <<200-80.0=120.0>>120.0 wooden planks.",
