  "flawed_nl_solution": "In Colbert's storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=10>>10 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 10 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+10+20=80>>80 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks - 80 owned wooden planks = <<200-80=120>>120 wooden planks.\n#### 120",
