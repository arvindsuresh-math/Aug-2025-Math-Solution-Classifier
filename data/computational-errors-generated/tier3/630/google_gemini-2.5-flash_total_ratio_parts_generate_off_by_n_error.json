  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the ratio of red candles to blue candles Avianna bought was 5:3, then the total ratio was 5+3 = 13.\nIf 5 represented 45 candles in the total ratio, then 13, the actual ratio, represents 13*45 = 585 divided by 5 is 585/5 = 117.0 candles.\nIf the total number of candles was 117.0, then the number of blue candles is 117.0 candles - 45 candles = <<117.0-45=72.0>>72.0 candles",
