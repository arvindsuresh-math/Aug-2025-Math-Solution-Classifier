  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the ratio of red candles to blue candles Avianna bought was 5:3, then the total ratio was 5+3 = 8.\nIf 5 represented 45 candles in the total ratio, then 8, the actual ratio, represents 8*45 = 360 divided by 5 is 360/5 = 72.0 candles.\nIf the total number of candles was 72.0, then the number of blue candles is 72.0 candles - 45 candles = <<72.0-45=72.0>>72.0 candles",
