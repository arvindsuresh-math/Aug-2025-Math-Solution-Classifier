  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the 144 acres of grass will be eaten according to the equation 5*2*T + 8*1*T = 144.\nSolving this equation for T, we find 18*T = 144, or T = 144/18 = <<144/18=8>>8 months of food are covered by the animals grazing on the rancher's pasture.\nThis means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 months.\nNext, the rancher's 8 sheep will require 4/2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8*2 = <<8*2=61>>61 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period.\nThe rancher's 5 cows will require 4/1 = 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5*4 = <<5*4=20>>20 bags of feed corn in total for the month.\nTherefore, the rancher needs 61+20 = <<61+20=81>>81 bags of feed corn for all of his animals.\nSo, the rancher will need to spend 81*10 = $<<81*10=810>>810 per year on feed corn.\n#### 810",
