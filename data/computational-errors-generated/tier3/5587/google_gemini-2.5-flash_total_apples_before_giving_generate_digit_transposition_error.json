  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of blue apples is 5, and if you receive twice as many yellow apples as the number of blue apples, there will be 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 yellow apples.\nAfter receiving the yellow apples, you now have 10 yellow apples+5 blue apples = <<10+5=51>>51 apples.\nWhen you give 1/5 of the total number of apples to the son, you part with 1/5*51 = <<1/5*51=51/5>>51/5 apples.\nThe total number of apples remaining is 51-51/5 = <<51-51/5=204/5>>204/5 apples.\n#### 204/5",
