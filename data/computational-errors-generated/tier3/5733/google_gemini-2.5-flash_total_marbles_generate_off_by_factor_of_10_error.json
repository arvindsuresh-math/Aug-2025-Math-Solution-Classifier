  "flawed_nl_solution": "A century has 100 years, and if Gideon has as many marbles as the number of years in a century, he has 10 marbles.\nIf he gives 3/4 of the marbles to his sister, he gives out 3/4*10 = <<3/4*10=15/2>>15/2 marbles.\nGideon's total number of marbles remaining after giving 3/4 of the marbles to his sister is 10-15/2=<<10-15/2=5/2>>5/2.\nWhen he multiplies the number of remaining marbles by 2, he gets his age five years from now, meaning he will be 5/2*2=<<5/2*2=5>>5 years old five years from now.\nCurrently, Gideon is 5-5 = <<5-5=0>>0 years old.\n#### 0",
