  "flawed_nl_solution": "A century has 100 years, and if Gideon has as many marbles as the number of years in a century, he has 1000 marbles.\nIf he gives 3/4 of the marbles to his sister, he gives out 3/4*1000 = <<3/4*1000=750>>750 marbles.\nGideon's total number of marbles remaining after giving 3/4 of the marbles to his sister is 1000-750=<<1000-750=250>>250.\nWhen he multiplies the number of remaining marbles by 2, he gets his age five years from now, meaning he will be 250*2=<<250*2=500>>500 years old five years from now.\nCurrently, Gideon is 500-5 = <<500-5=495>>495 years old.\n#### 495",
