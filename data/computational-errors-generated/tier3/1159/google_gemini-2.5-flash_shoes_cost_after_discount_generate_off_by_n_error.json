  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total discount of a pair of shoes is $200 x 3/10 = $<<200*3/10=60>>60.\nHe spent $200 - $60 = $<<200-60=141>>141 for a pair of shoes.\nThe total cost of two shirts is $80 x 2 = $<<80*2=160>>160.\nThe initial cost of his purchase is $141 + $160 = $<<141+160=301>>301.\nHe got an additional $301 x 1/20 = $<<301*1/20=301/20>>301/20 discount upon checkout.\nTherefore, Erwan spent $301 - 301/20 = $<<301-301/20=5719/20>>5719/20 after all the discounts.",
