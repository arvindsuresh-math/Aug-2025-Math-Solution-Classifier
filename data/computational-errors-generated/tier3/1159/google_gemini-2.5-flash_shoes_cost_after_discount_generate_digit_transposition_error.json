  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total discount of a pair of shoes is $200 x 3/10 = $<<200*3/10=60>>60.\nHe spent $200 - $60 = $<<200-60=410>>410 for a pair of shoes.\nThe total cost of two shirts is $80 x 2 = $<<80*2=160>>160.\nThe initial cost of his purchase is $410 + $160 = $<<410+160=570>>570.\nHe got an additional $570 x 1/20 = $<<570*1/20=57/2>>57/2 discount upon checkout.\nTherefore, Erwan spent $570 - 57/2 = $<<570-57/2=1083/2>>1083/2 after all the discounts.",
