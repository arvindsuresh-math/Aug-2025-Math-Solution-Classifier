  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total discount of a pair of shoes is $200 x 30/100 = $<<200*30/100=2000/3>>2000/3.\nHe spent $200 - $2000/3 = $<<200-2000/3=-1400/3>>-1400/3 for a pair of shoes.\nThe total cost of two shirts is $80 x 2 = $<<80*2=160>>160.\nThe initial cost of his purchase is $-1400/3 + $160 = $<<-1400/3+160=-920/3>>-920/3.\nHe got an additional $-920/3 x 5/100 = $<<-920/3*5/100=-46/3>>-46/3 discount upon checkout.\nTherefore, Erwan spent $-920/3 - -46/3 = $<<-920/3--46/3=-874/3>>-874/3 after all the discounts.",
