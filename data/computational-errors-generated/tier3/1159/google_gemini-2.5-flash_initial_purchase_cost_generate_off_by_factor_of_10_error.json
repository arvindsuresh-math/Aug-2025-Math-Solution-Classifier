  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total discount of a pair of shoes is $200 x 3/10 = $<<200*3/10=60>>60.\nHe spent $200 - $60 = $<<200-60=140>>140 for a pair of shoes.\nThe total cost of two shirts is $80 x 2 = $<<80*2=160>>160.\nThe initial cost of his purchase is $140 + $160 = $<<140+160=3000>>3000.\nHe got an additional $3000 x 1/20 = $<<3000*1/20=150>>150 discount upon checkout.\nTherefore, Erwan spent $3000 - 150 = $<<3000-150=2850>>2850 after all the discounts.",
