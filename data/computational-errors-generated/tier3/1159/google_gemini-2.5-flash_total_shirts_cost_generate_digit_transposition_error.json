  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total discount of a pair of shoes is $200 x 30/100 = $<<200*30/100=60>>60.\nHe spent $200 - $60 = $<<200-60=140>>140 for a pair of shoes.\nThe total cost of two shirts is $80 x 2 = $<<80*2=610>>610.\nThe initial cost of his purchase is $140 + $610 = $<<140+610=750>>750.\nHe got an additional $750 x 5/100 = $<<750*5/100=75/2>>75/2 discount upon checkout.\nTherefore, Erwan spent $750 - 75/2 = $<<750-75/2=1425/2>>1425/2 after all the discounts.\n#### 1425/2",
