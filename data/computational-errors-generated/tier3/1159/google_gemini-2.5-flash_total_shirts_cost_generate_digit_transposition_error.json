  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total discount of a pair of shoes is $200 x 3/10 = $<<200*3/10=60>>60.\nHe spent $200 - $60 = $<<200-60=140>>140 for a pair of shoes.\nThe total cost of two shirts is $80 x 2 = $<<80*2=106>>106.\nThe initial cost of his purchase is $140 + $106 = $<<140+106=246>>246.\nHe got an additional $246 x 1/20 = $<<246*1/20=123/10>>123/10 discount upon checkout.\nTherefore, Erwan spent $246 - 123/10 = $<<246-123/10=2337/10>>2337/10 after all the discounts.",
