  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15 unused crayons from each box.\nSo, a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 unused crayons are in the two boxes.\nFor the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box.\nHence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=10>>10 unused crayons.\nSo, a total of 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 unused crayons are in the other two boxes.\nTherefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 20 + 24 = <<30+20+24=74>>74 unused crayons.",
