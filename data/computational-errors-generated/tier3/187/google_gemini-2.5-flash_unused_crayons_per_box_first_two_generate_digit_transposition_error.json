  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=51>>51 unused crayons from each box.\nSo, a total of 51 x 2 = <<51*2=102>>102 unused crayons are in the two boxes.\nFor the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box.\nHence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 unused crayons.\nSo, a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes.\nTherefore, Madeline has a total of 102 + 16 + 24 = <<102+16+24=142>>142 unused crayons.",
