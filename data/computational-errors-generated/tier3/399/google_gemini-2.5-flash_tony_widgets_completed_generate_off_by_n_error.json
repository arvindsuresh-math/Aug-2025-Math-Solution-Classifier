  "flawed_nl_solution": "Sam worked for 6 hours yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = <<6*60/10=36>>36 widgets.\nJack worked for 4 hours, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = <<4*60/15=16>>16 widgets.\nSam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete 68 widgets together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = <<68-36-16=20>>20 widgets.\nIt took Tony 8 hours to complete those 20 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 20 widgets = <<8*60/20=24>>24 minutes per widget.\n#### 24",
