  "flawed_nl_solution": "Sam worked for 6 hours yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = <<6*60/10=36.0>>36.0 widgets.\nJack worked for 4 hours, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = <<4*60/15=16.0>>16.0 widgets.\nSam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete 68 widgets together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36.0 widgets - 16.0 widgets = <<68-36.0-16.0=15.0>>15.0 widgets.\nIt took Tony 8 hours to complete those 15.0 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15.0 widgets = <<8*60/15.0=32.0>>32.0 minutes per widget.",
