  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second tank is 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24.0>>24.0 gallons.\nFollowing her rule, Gail keeps 24.0 / 2 = <<24.0/2=12.0>>12.0 two-inch fish in the second tank.\nShe keeps 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16.0>>16.0 fish in the first tank.\nIf one fish in the first tank ate another, she would have 16.0 - 1 = <<16.0-1=18.0>>18.0 fish in the first tank.\nThus, Gail would have 18.0 - 12.0 = <<18.0-12.0=6.0>>6.0 more fish in the first tank.",
