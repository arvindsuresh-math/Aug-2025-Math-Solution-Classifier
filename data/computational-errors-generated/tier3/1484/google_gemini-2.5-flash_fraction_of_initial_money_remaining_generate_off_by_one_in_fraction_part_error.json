  "flawed_nl_solution": "The $15 is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the money left.\nSince 3/4 is equal to $15, then 1/4 is equal to $15/{fraction_of_money_left_after_spending.numerator} = $5.\nSo Lucy had $5 x {fraction_of_money_left_after_spending.denominator} = $<<5*{fraction_of_money_left_after_spending.denominator}=20>>20 left after losing 1/3 of her money.\nHence, $20 is 1 - 1/3 = 1/3 of the money that Lucy had at the beginning.\nSince 1/3 is equal to $20, then 1/3 is equal to $20/{fraction_of_initial_money_remaining.numerator} = $20.\nTherefore, Lucy had $20 x {fraction_of_initial_money_remaining.denominator} = $<<20*{fraction_of_initial_money_remaining.denominator}=60>>60 at the beginning.",
