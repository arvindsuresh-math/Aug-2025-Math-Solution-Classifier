  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find half the number of guests at Carly's party: 30 guests / 2 = <<30/2=15.0>>15.0 guests\nThen multiply that number by 2 for the number of burgers half the guests want: 15.0 guests * 2 burgers/guest = <<15.0*2=30.0>>30.0 burgers\nThen add the 15.0 burgers for the 15.0 guests who only want 1 to find the total number of burgers: 30.0 burgers + 15.0 burgers = 45.0 burgers\nThen divide the total number of burgers by the number of burgers Carly can cook at once to find the number of batches she cooks: 45.0 burgers / 5 burgers/batch = <<45.0/5=9.0>>9.0 batches\nThen multiply the number of sides per burger by the cooking time per side to find each burger's total cook time: 4 minutes/side * 2 sides = <<4*2=8>>8 minutes\nFinally, multiply each batch's cook time by the number of batches to find the total cook time: 8 minutes/batch * 9.0 batches = <<8*9.0=27.0>>27.0 minutes",
