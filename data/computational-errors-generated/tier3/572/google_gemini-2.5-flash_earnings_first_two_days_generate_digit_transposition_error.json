  "flawed_nl_solution": "On Monday, Steve was paid 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 dollars\nTuesday's harvest was 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 pounds\nThe 24 pounds Steve picked on Tuesday gave him 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 dollars\nSo, the amount Steve earned from the first two days on the job is 16 +48 = <<16+48=46>>46 dollars\nSince Steve rested on Wednesday, he made 0 dollars, meaning his earnings were 46 + 0 = <<46+0=46>>46 dollars\nThe difference between Steve's earnings and his target is 100 - 46 = <<100-46=54>>54 dollars\nSince he was paid 2 dollars for each pound of lingonberries, Steve needed to pick 54/2 = <<54/2=27.0>>27.0 pounds",
