  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second supplier receives 1000000 + 500000 = 1500000 cars.\nThe third supplier receives 1000000 + 1500000 = 2499970 cars.\nSo the first to third suppliers receive a total of 1000000 + 1500000 + 2499970 = 4999970 cars.\nThus, 5650000 - 4999970 = 650030 cars are left to be divided by the two other suppliers.\nTherefore, the fourth and fifth suppliers receive 650030/2 = 325015 cars each.\n#### 325015",
