  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second supplier receives 1000000 + 500000 = 1500000 cars.\nThe third supplier receives 1000000 + 1500000 = 2500000 cars.\nSo the first to third suppliers receive a total of 1000000 + 1500000 + 2500000 = 4999980 cars.\nThus, 5650000 - 4999980 = 650020 cars are left to be divided by the two other suppliers.\nTherefore, the fourth and fifth suppliers receive 650020/2 = 325010 cars each.\n#### 325010",
