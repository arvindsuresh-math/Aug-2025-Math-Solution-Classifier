  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second supplier receives 1000000 + 500000 = 1500030 cars.\nThe third supplier receives 1000000 + 1500030 = 2500030 cars.\nSo the first to third suppliers receive a total of 1000000 + 1500030 + 2500030 = 5000060 cars.\nThus, 5650000 - 5000060 = 649940 cars are left to be divided by the two other suppliers.\nTherefore, the fourth and fifth suppliers receive 649940/2 = 324970 cars each.\n#### 324970",
