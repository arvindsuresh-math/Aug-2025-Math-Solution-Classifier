  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second supplier receives 1000000 + 500000 = 1500010 cars.\nThe third supplier receives 1000000 + 1500010 = 2500010 cars.\nSo the first to third suppliers receive a total of 1000000 + 1500010 + 2500010 = 5000020 cars.\nThus, 5650000 - 5000020 = 649980 cars are left to be divided by the two other suppliers.\nTherefore, the fourth and fifth suppliers receive 649980/2 = 324990 cars each.\n#### 324990",
