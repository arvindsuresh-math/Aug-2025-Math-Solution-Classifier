  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second supplier receives 1000000 + 500000 = 1050000 cars.\nThe third supplier receives 1000000 + 1050000 = 2050000 cars.\nSo the first to third suppliers receive a total of 1000000 + 1050000 + 2050000 = 4100000 cars.\nThus, 5650000 - 4100000 = 1550000 cars are left to be divided by the two other suppliers.\nTherefore, the fourth and fifth suppliers receive 1550000/2 = 775000 cars each.\n#### 775000",
