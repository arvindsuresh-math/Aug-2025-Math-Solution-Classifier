  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are twice as many frogs as dogs in the compound, meaning there are 160/2 = <<160/2=80.0>>80.0 dogs.\nThe total number of frogs and dogs in the compound is 80.0+160 = <<80.0+160=204.0>>204.0\nThe number of cats is less than 20/100 of the number of dogs, which means there are 20/100*80.0 = <<20/100*80.0=16.0>>16.0 dogs more than the number of cats.\nTherefore, the number of cats is 80.0-16.0 = <<80.0-16.0=64.0>>64.0 cats\nThe total number of animals in the compound is 64.0 cats +204.0 dogs and frogs = <<64.0+204.0=268.0>>268.0 animals.",
