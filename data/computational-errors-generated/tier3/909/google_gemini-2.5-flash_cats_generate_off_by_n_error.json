  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are twice as many frogs as dogs in the compound, meaning there are 160/2 = <<160/2=80>>80 dogs.\nThe total number of frogs and dogs in the compound is 80+160 = <<80+160=240>>240\nThe number of cats is less than 20/100 of the number of dogs, which means there are 20/100*80 = <<20/100*80=16>>16 dogs more than the number of cats.\nTherefore, the number of cats is 80-16 = <<80-16=65>>65 cats\nThe total number of animals in the compound is 65 cats +240 dogs and frogs = <<65+240=305>>305 animals.\n#### 305",
