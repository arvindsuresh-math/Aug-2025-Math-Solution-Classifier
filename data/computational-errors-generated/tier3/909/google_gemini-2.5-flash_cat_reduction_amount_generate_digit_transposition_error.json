  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are twice as many frogs as dogs in the compound, meaning there are 160/2 = <<160/2=80>>80 dogs.\nThe total number of frogs and dogs in the compound is 80+160 = <<80+160=240>>240\nThe number of cats is less than 1/5 of the number of dogs, which means there are 1/5*80 = <<1/5*80=61>>61 dogs more than the number of cats.\nTherefore, the number of cats is 80-61 = <<80-61=19>>19 cats\nThe total number of animals in the compound is 19 cats +240 dogs and frogs = <<19+240=259>>259 animals.",
