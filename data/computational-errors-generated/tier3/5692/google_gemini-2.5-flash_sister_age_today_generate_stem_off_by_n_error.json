  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Sebastian is 40 years old and 10 years older than his sister, his sister is 40-10=<<40-10=60>>60 years old.\nFive years ago, Sebastian was 40-5=<<40-5=35>>35 years old.\nSimilarly, Sebastian's sister's age was 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55 years old.\nThe sum of their ages five years ago was 55+35=<<55+35=90>>90\nFive years ago, the sum of Sebastian's age and his sister's age was 3/4 of their father's age, meaning their father's age was 90 / 3/4 = 120 years.\nThe father's age is now 120+5=<<120+5=125>>125\n#### 125",
