  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first movie was 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long since an hour has 60 minutes.\nThe second movie was 90 + 30 = <<90+30=120>>120 minutes long.\nIt took them a total of 90 + 120 = <<90+120=210>>210 minutes to watch the two movies.\nIt took them 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes to cook the fries.\nThus, it took them a total of 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 minutes to cook.\nSo, they spent 210 + 30 = <<210+30=420>>420 minutes watching the movies and cooking.\nIn hours, this is equal to 420/60 = <<420/60=7>>7 hours.",
