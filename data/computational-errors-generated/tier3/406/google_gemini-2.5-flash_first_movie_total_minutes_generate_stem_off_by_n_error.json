  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first movie was 60 + 30 = <<60+30=120>>120 minutes long since an hour has 60 minutes.\nThe second movie was 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 minutes long.\nIt took them a total of 120 + 150 = <<120+150=270>>270 minutes to watch the two movies.\nIt took them 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes to cook the fries.\nThus, it took them a total of 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 minutes to cook.\nSo, they spent 270 + 30 = <<270+30=300>>300 minutes watching the movies and cooking.\nIn hours, this is equal to 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours.\n#### 5",
