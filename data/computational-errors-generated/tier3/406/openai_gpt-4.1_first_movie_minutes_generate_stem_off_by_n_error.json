  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first movie was 60 + 30 = <<60+30=60>>60 minutes long since an hour has 60 minutes.\nThe second movie was 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long.\nIt took them a total of 60 + 90 = <<60+90=150>>150 minutes to watch the two movies.\nIt took them 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes to cook the fries.\nThus, it took them a total of 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 minutes to cook.\nSo, they spent 150 + 30 = <<150+30=180>>180 minutes watching the movies and cooking.\nIn hours, this is equal to 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours.",
