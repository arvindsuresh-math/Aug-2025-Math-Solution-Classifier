  "flawed_nl_solution": "The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=10000/1>>10000/1.\nSo its selling price after a week was $500 - $10000/1 = $<<500-10000/1=-9500>>-9500.\nThe price of the bag was again reduced by $-9500 x 4/100 = $<<-9500*4/100=-380>>-380.\nSo, its selling price now is $-9500 - $-380 = $<<-9500--380=-9120>>-9120.\nTherefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $-9120 = $<<500--9120=9620>>9620.\n#### 9620",
