  "flawed_nl_solution": "Three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60, meaning together they have 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 marbles.\nIf Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, and Atticus has 4 marbles, Jensen has 2*4=<<4*2=8>>8 marbles.\nTogether, Atticus and Jensen have 8+4=<<8+4=12>>12 marbles.\nSince the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 20, and Atticus and Jensen have 12 marbles, Cruz has 20-12=<<20-12=13>>13 marbles.\n#### 13",
