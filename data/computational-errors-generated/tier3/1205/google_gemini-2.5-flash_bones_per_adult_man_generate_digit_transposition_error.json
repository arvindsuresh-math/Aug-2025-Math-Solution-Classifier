  "flawed_nl_solution": "We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 adult women's skeletons.\nThe remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10/2= <<10/2=5>>5 of each.\nSince an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 bones in total.\nSince an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= <<20+5=52>>52 bones in their body.\nThere are 5 adult men, meaning there are 52*5=<<52*5=260>>260 bones in the adult male skeletons in total.\nSince a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= <<20/2=10>>10 bones in their body.\nSince there are 5 children, this means there are 5*10= <<5*10=50>>50 bones in the children's skeletons in total.\nTherefore, altogether there are 50+260+200= <<50+260+200=510>>510 bones in total in the graveyard.",
