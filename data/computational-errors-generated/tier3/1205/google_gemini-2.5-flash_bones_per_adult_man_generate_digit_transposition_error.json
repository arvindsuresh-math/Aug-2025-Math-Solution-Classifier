  "flawed_nl_solution": "We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=<<20/2=10.0>>10.0 adult women's skeletons.\nThe remaining half, 10.0, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10.0/2= <<10.0/2=5.0>>5.0 of each.\nSince an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10.0 skeletons have 20*10.0=<<20*10.0=200.0>>200.0 bones in total.\nSince an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= <<20+5=52>>52 bones in their body.\nThere are 5.0 adult men, meaning there are 52*5.0=<<52*5.0=260.0>>260.0 bones in the adult male skeletons in total.\nSince a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= <<20/2=10.0>>10.0 bones in their body.\nSince there are 5.0 children, this means there are 5.0*10.0= <<5.0*10.0=50.0>>50.0 bones in the children's skeletons in total.\nTherefore, altogether there are 50.0+260.0+200.0= <<50.0+260.0+200.0=510.0>>510.0 bones in total in the graveyard.",
