  "flawed_nl_solution": "Heisenberg sells a total of $80/5= <<80/5=61>>61 capsules of 100 mg amoxicillin every week.\nSo, the total number of 100 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 61 x 2= <<61*2=122>>122.\nAnd he sells $60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 capsules of 500 mg amoxicillin every week.\nSo, the total number of 500 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 30 x 2= 60.\nTherefore, the total number of capsules he sells every 2 weeks is 60 + 122 = <<60+122=182>>182.",
