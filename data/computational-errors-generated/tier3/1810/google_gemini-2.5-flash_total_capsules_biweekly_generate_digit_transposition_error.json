  "flawed_nl_solution": "Heisenberg sells a total of $80/5= <<80/5=16.0>>16.0 capsules of 100 mg amoxicillin every week.\nSo, the total number of 100 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 16.0 x 2= <<16.0*2=32.0>>32.0.\nAnd he sells $60/2= <<60/2=30.0>>30.0 capsules of 500 mg amoxicillin every week.\nSo, the total number of 500 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 30.0 x 2= 60.0.\nTherefore, the total number of capsules he sells every 2 weeks is 60.0 + 32.0 = <<60.0+32.0=29.0>>29.0.",
