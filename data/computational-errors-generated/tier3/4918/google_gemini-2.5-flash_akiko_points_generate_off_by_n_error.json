  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Bailey scored 14 points, and Michiko scored half as many points as Bailey, then Michiko scored 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 points.\nIf Akiko scored 4 more points than did Michiko, then Akiko scored 7+4=14 points.\nSince Chandra scored twice as many points as did Akiko, then Chandra scored 14*2=<<14*2=28>>28 points.\nThus, in total, the team scored 14+7+14+28=<<14+7+14+28=63>>63 points in total during the final game of the season.\n#### 63",
