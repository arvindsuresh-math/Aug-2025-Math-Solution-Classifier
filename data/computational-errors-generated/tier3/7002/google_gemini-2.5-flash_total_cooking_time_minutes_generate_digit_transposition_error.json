  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bakes a turkey for 15 minutes a pound and the turkey is 16 pounds so it takes 15*16 = <<15*16=240>>240 minutes\nShe has 2 turkeys to roast and one turkey takes 240 minutes to cook so 2 turkeys will take 2*240 = <<2*240=840>>840 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour and these turkeys will take 840 minutes to cook so that's 840/60 = <<840/60=14>>14 hours\nIn military time, 6:00 pm is 18:00 hours (12 hours +6 hours) and it takes 14 hours to cook the turkeys so the latest she can start is 18- 14 = 4:00 am\n#### 4",
