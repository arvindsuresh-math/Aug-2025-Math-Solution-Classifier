  "flawed_nl_solution": "We can find how long the hare spends running by dividing the distance of the race by the hare's speed: 20 feet / 10 feet/second = <<20/10=2.0>>2.0 seconds\nWe can do the same for the turtle: 20 feet / 1 foot/second = <<20/1=20.0>>20.0 seconds\nFinally, subtract the hare's run time from the turtle's run time to find the length of the head start the turtle needs: 20.0 seconds - 2.0 seconds = <<20.0-2.0=23.0>>23.0 seconds",
