  "flawed_nl_solution": "When they added two more courses for the wall, the number of courses became 3+2 = <<3+2=5>>5\nSince each course has 400 bricks, the total number of bricks for 5 courses is 5*400 = <<5*400=2000>>2000\nTo allow for an easy checkup of the wall, they removed 1/2*400 = <<1/2*400=800/1>>800/1 bricks from the last course of the wall.\nIn total, the wall has 2000-800/1= <<2000-800/1=1200>>1200 bricks.\n#### 1200",
