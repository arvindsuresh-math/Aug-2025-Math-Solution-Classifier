  "flawed_nl_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 19 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours - 19 used hours = <<25-19=6>>6 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 6 hours / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 3",
