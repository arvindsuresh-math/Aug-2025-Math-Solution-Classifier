  "flawed_nl_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours - 21 used hours = <<25-21=2>>2 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 2 hours / 2 = <<2/2=1.0>>1.0 hours studying on Saturday.",
