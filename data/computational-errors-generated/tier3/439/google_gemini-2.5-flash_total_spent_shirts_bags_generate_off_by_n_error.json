  "flawed_nl_solution": "The two t-shirts amount to $8 x 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.\nThe two bags amount to $10 x 2= $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo Timothy spent $16 + $20 = $<<16+20=34>>34 for the shirts and bags.\nHe still has $50 - $34 = $<<50-34=16>>16 left to spend for the key chains.\nWith the money, he can buy $16/$2 = <<16/2=8.0>>8.0 sets of key chains.\nTherefore, he can buy 8.0 x 3 = <<8.0*3=24.0>>24.0 pieces of key chains.",
