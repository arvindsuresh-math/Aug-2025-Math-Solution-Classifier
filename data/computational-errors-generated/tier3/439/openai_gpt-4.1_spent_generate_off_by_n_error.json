  "flawed_nl_solution": "The two t-shirts amount to $8 x 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.\nThe two bags amount to $10 x 2= $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo Timothy spent $16 + $20 = $<<16+20=32>>32 for the shirts and bags.\nHe still has $50 - $32 = $<<50-32=18>>18 left to spend for the key chains.\nWith the money, he can buy $18/$2 = <<18/2=9.0>>9.0 sets of key chains.\nTherefore, he can buy 9.0 x 3 = <<9.0*3=27.0>>27.0 pieces of key chains.",
