  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each pair of boxes weighs 40 pounds + 10 pounds, or <<40+10=80>>80 pounds.\nEach pair weighs 80 pounds, so the delivery trucks can carry 2000 / 80 pairs of boxes or <<2000/80=25>>25 pairs.\nSteven has three trucks, so each trip can move 25 * 3 pairs of boxes = <<25*3=75>>75 pairs of boxes.\nEach pair is a set of 2 boxes, so each delivery contains 75 * 2 boxes = <<75*2=150>>150 boxes\n#### 150",
