  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each pair of boxes weighs 40 pounds + 10 pounds, or <<40+10=50>>50 pounds.\nEach pair weighs 50 pounds, so the delivery trucks can carry 2000 / 50 pairs of boxes or <<2000/50=40>>40 pairs.\nSteven has three trucks, so each trip can move 40 * 3 pairs of boxes = <<40*3=120>>120 pairs of boxes.\nEach pair is a set of 2 boxes, so each delivery contains 120 * 2 boxes = <<120*2=420>>420 boxes\n#### 420",
