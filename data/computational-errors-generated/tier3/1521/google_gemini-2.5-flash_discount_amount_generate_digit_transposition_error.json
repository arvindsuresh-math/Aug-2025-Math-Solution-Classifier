  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=220>>220.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=360>>360.\nThus, the total amount is $220 + $360 = $<<220+360=580>>580.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 1/20 x 580 = $<<1/20*580=92>>92.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $580 - $92 = $<<580-92=488>>488.",
