  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=202>>202.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=360>>360.\nThus, the total amount is $202 + $360 = $<<202+360=562>>562.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 5/100 x 562 = $<<5/100*562=281/10>>281/10.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $562 - $281/10 = $<<562-281/10=5339/10>>5339/10.",
