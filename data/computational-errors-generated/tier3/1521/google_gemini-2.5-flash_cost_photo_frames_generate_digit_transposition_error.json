  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=220>>220.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=306>>306.\nThus, the total amount is $220 + $306 = $<<220+306=526>>526.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 5/100 x 526 = $<<5/100*526=263/10>>263/10.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $526 - $263/10 = $<<526-263/10=4997/10>>4997/10.\n#### 4997/10",
