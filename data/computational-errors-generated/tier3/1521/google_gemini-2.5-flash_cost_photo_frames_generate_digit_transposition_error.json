  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=220>>220.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=630>>630.\nThus, the total amount is $220 + $630 = $<<220+630=850>>850.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 1/20 x 850 = $<<1/20*850=85/2>>85/2.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $850 - $85/2 = $<<850-85/2=1615/2>>1615/2.",
