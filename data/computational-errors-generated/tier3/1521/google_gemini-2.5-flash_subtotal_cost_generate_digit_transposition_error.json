  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=220>>220.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=360>>360.\nThus, the total amount is $220 + $360 = $<<220+360=508>>508.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 5/100 x 508 = $<<5/100*508=127/5>>127/5.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $508 - $127/5 = $<<508-127/5=2413/5>>2413/5.\n#### 2413/5",
