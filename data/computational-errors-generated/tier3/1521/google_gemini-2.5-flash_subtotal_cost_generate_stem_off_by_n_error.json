  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=220>>220.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=360>>360.\nThus, the total amount is $220 + $360 = $<<220+360=560>>560.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 5/100 x 560 = $<<5/100*560=28>>28.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $560 - $28 = $<<560-28=532>>532.\n#### 532",
