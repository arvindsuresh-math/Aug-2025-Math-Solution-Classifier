  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two instant camera cost 2 x $110 = $<<2*110=220>>220.\nThree digital photo frames cost 3 x $120 = $<<3*120=360>>360.\nThus, the total amount is $220 + $360 = $<<220+360=610>>610.\nSo, Selena gets a discount of 5/100 x 610 = $<<5/100*610=61/2>>61/2.\nTherefore, Selena pays a total of $610 - $61/2 = $<<610-61/2=1159/2>>1159/2.\n#### 1159/2",
