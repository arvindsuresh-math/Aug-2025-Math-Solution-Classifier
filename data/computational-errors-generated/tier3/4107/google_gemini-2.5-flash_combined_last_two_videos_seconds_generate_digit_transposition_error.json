  "flawed_nl_solution": "First convert the length of the first video to seconds: 2 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds\nThen convert the length of the second video to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 30 seconds = 240 seconds + 30 seconds = <<4*60+30=270>>270 seconds\nNow subtract the length of the first two videos from the total time Kimiko spent watching to find the combined length of the last two videos: 510 seconds - 120 seconds - 270 seconds = <<510-120-270=210>>210 seconds\nNow divide the combined length by the number of videos to find each video's length: 210 seconds / 2 = <<210/2=105>>105 seconds\n#### 105",
