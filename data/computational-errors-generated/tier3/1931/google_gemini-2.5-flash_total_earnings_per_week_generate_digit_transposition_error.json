  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the shop is open 12 hours * 60 minutes = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes per day.\nSo, 720 / 30 = <<720/30=24>>24 women's T-shirts sold per day.\nThe shop earns 24 * $18 = $<<24*18=432>>432 selling women's T-shirts per day.\nSimilarly, 720 / 40 = <<720/40=18>>18 men's T-shirts are sold per day.\nThe shop earns 18 * $15 = $<<18*15=270>>270 selling men's T-shirts per day.\nThe shop earns $432 + $270 = $<<432+270=702>>702 per day selling T-shirts.\nThe shop earns $702 * 7 = $<<702*7=4941>>4941 per week.\n#### 4941",
