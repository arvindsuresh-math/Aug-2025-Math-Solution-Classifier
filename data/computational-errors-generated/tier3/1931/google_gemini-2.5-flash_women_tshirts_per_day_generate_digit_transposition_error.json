  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the shop is open 12 hours * 60 minutes = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes per day.\nSo, 720 / 30 = <<720/30=42.0>>42.0 women's T-shirts sold per day.\nThe shop earns 42.0 * $18 = $<<42.0*18=756.0>>756.0 selling women's T-shirts per day.\nSimilarly, 720 / 40 = <<720/40=18.0>>18.0 men's T-shirts are sold per day.\nThe shop earns 18.0 * $15 = $<<18.0*15=270.0>>270.0 selling men's T-shirts per day.\nThe shop earns $756.0 + $270.0 = $<<756.0+270.0=1026.0>>1026.0 per day selling T-shirts.\nThe shop earns $1026.0 * 7 = $<<1026.0*7=7182.0>>7182.0 per week.",
