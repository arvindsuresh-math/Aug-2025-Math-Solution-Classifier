  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the shop is open 12 hours * 60 minutes = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes per day.\nSo, 720 / 30 = <<720/30=24.0>>24.0 women's T-shirts sold per day.\nThe shop earns 24.0 * $18 = $<<24.0*18=432.0>>432.0 selling women's T-shirts per day.\nSimilarly, 720 / 40 = <<720/40=81.0>>81.0 men's T-shirts are sold per day.\nThe shop earns 81.0 * $15 = $<<81.0*15=1215.0>>1215.0 selling men's T-shirts per day.\nThe shop earns $432.0 + $1215.0 = $<<432.0+1215.0=1647.0>>1647.0 per day selling T-shirts.\nThe shop earns $1647.0 * 7 = $<<1647.0*7=11529.0>>11529.0 per week.",
