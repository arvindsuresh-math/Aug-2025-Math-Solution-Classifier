  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, you need to set up the problem with the information given. The cost of the skirts and art supplies must equal $50<<50=50>>50.\nTo solve the equation, subtract 20 from both sides, to give you the new equation: 2x = 50.\nSolve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, 2x/2 = 50/2 gives you x = 25.\nTherefore, each skirt cost $25<<25=25>>25.\n#### 25",
