  "flawed_nl_solution": "Hasan figured out the movers' weight limit was 20 pounds. Since a pound is equal to 16 ounces, each box can hold 20 * 16, or <<20*16=230>>230 ounces.\nDividing both sides by 10 leaves 38-x = 23.\nSubtracting 23 from both sides gives the value of x, which is the number of plates removed from the box, 38 -23 = 23 + x - 23, or, 15 = x\n#### 15",
