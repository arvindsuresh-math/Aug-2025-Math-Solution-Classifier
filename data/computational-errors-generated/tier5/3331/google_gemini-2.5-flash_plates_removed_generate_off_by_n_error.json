  "flawed_nl_solution": "Hasan figured out the movers' weight limit was 20 pounds. Since a pound is equal to 16 ounces, each box can hold 20 * 16, or <<20*16=320>>320 ounces.\nDividing both sides by 10 leaves 38-x = 32.\nSubtracting 32 from both sides gives the value of x, which is the number of plates removed from the box, 38 -32 = 32 + x - 32, or, 3 = x\n#### 3",
