  "flawed_nl_solution": "In 3 years, the sum of their present ages will be added by 3 (from Allen) + 3 (from her mother) = <<3+3=6>>6.\nSo, the sum of their present ages is 41 - 6 = <<41-6=39>>39.\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 64.\nHence, Allen's mother is x = 64/2 = <<64/2=32>>32 years old now.\n#### 32",
