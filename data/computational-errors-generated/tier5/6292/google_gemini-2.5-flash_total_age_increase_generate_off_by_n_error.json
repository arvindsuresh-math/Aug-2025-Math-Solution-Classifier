  "flawed_nl_solution": "In 3 years, the sum of their present ages will be added by 3 (from Allen) + 3 (from her mother) = <<3+3=4>>4.\nSo, the sum of their present ages is 41 - 4 = <<41-4=37>>37.\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 62.\nHence, Allen's mother is x = 62/2 = <<62/2=31>>31 years old now.\n#### 31",
