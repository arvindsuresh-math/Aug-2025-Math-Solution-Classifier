  "flawed_nl_solution": "In 3 years, the sum of their present ages will be added by 3 (from Allen) + 3 (from her mother) = <<3+3=8>>8.\nSo, the sum of their present ages is 41 - 8 = <<41-8=33>>33.\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 58.\nHence, Allen's mother is x = 58/2 = <<58/2=29>>29 years old now.\n#### 29",
