  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the first 4 hours, the milk tanker got 4 hours * 2880 gallons/hour = <<4*2880=11520>>11520 gallons\nThus, the storage tank was left with 30000 gallons - 11520 gallons = <<30000-11520=18480>>18480 gallons.\nFor the next 7 hrs, the workers added 1500 gallons/hour * 7 hours = <<1500*7=105000>>105000 gallons\nThe total therefore is 18480 gallons + 105000 gallons = <<18480+105000=123480>>123480 gallons\n#### 123480",
