  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the total cost of an orange and a pear is $120, and a pear costs $90, an orange costs $120-$90 = $<<120-90=30>>30\nSince the difference between the price of an orange and a pear is the price of a banana, a banana is sold at $90-$30 = $<<90-30=90>>90\nTo buy 200 bananas, you'll pay $90*200 = $<<90*200=18000>>18000\nWhen you twice as many oranges as bananas, you buy 2*200 = <<2*200=400>>400 oranges.\nThe total cost of buying 400 oranges is 400*30 = $<<400*30=12000>>12000\nThe total price of buying 200 bananas and twice as many oranges as bananas is $18000+$12000 = $30000\n#### 30000",
