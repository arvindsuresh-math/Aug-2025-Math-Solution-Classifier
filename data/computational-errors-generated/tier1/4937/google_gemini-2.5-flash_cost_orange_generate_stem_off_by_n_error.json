  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the total cost of an orange and a pear is $120, and a pear costs $90, an orange costs $120-$90 = $<<120-90=40>>40\nSince the difference between the price of an orange and a pear is the price of a banana, a banana is sold at $90-$40 = $<<90-40=50>>50\nTo buy 200 bananas, you'll pay $50*200 = $<<50*200=10000>>10000\nWhen you twice as many oranges as bananas, you buy 2*200 = <<2*200=400>>400 oranges.\nThe total cost of buying 400 oranges is 400*40 = $<<400*40=16000>>16000\nThe total price of buying 200 bananas and twice as many oranges as bananas is $10000+$16000 = $26000\n#### 26000",
