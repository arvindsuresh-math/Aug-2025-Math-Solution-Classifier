  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of the two laptops is 2 x $600 = $<<2*600=1200>>1200.\nThe cost of the four smartphones is 4 x $400 = $<<4*400=1600>>1600.\nThus, the total cost of all the items is $1200 + $1600 = $<<1200+1600=2080>>2080.\nTherefore, Celine gets a change of $3000 - $2080 = $<<3000-2080=920>>920.\n#### 920",
