  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of the two laptops is 2 x $600 = $<<2*600=120>>120.\nThe cost of the four smartphones is 4 x $400 = $<<4*400=1600>>1600.\nThus, the total cost of all the items is $120 + $1600 = $<<120+1600=1720>>1720.\nTherefore, Celine gets a change of $3000 - $1720 = $<<3000-1720=1280>>1280.\n#### 1280",
