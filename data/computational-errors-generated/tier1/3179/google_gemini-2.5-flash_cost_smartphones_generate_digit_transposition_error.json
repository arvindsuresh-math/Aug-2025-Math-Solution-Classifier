  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of the two laptops is 2 x $600 = $<<2*600=1200>>1200.\nThe cost of the four smartphones is 4 x $400 = $<<4*400=1060>>1060.\nThus, the total cost of all the items is $1200 + $1060 = $<<1200+1060=2260>>2260.\nTherefore, Celine gets a change of $3000 - $2260 = $<<3000-2260=740>>740.\n#### 740",
