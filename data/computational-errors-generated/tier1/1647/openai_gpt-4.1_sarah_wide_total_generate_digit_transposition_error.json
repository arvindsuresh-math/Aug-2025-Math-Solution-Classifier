  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the rooms with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 10 reflections * 3 passes = <<10*3=30>>30 times.\nIn the rooms with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 5 reflections * 5 passes = <<5*5=52>>52 reflections.\nSo Sarah saw her reflection a total of 30 + 52 = <<30+52=82>>82 times.\nIn the rooms with tall mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 6 reflections * 3 passes = <<6*3=18>>18 times.\nIn the rooms with wide mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 3 reflections * 5 passes = <<3*5=15>>15 times.\nSo Ellie saw her reflection a total of 18 + 15 = <<18+15=33>>33 times.\nTherefore, Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections a total of 82 + 33 = <<82+33=115>>115 times.",
