  "flawed_nl_solution": "In the rooms with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 10 reflections * 3 passes = <<10*3=30>>30 times.\nIn the rooms with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 5 reflections * 5 passes = <<5*5=25>>25 reflections.\nSo Sarah saw her reflection a total of 30 + 25 = <<30+25=55>>55 times.\nIn the rooms with tall mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 6 reflections * 3 passes = <<6*3=81>>81 times.\nIn the rooms with wide mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 3 reflections * 5 passes = <<3*5=15>>15 times.\nSo Ellie saw her reflection a total of 81 + 15 = <<81+15=96>>96 times.\nTherefore, Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections a total of 55 + 96 = <<55+96=151>>151 times.",
