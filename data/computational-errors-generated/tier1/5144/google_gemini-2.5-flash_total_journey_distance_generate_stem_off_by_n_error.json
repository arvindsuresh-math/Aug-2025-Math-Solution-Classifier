  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the distance he took traveling to the East is 20 miles more than the distance he took to travel to the south, he took 40+20 = 60 miles traveling to the East.\nJohny's total distance traveling to the south and then to the East is 60+40 = <<60+40=100>>100 miles.\nThe journey to the North was 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120, twice the distance he took traveling to the East.\nThe whole journey took 100+120 = <<100+120=210>>210 miles.\n#### 210",
