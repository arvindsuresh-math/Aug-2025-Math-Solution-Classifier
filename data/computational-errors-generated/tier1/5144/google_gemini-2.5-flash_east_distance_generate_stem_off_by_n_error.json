  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the distance he took traveling to the East is 20 miles more than the distance he took to travel to the south, he took 40+20 = 90 miles traveling to the East.\nJohny's total distance traveling to the south and then to the East is 90+40 = <<90+40=130>>130 miles.\nThe journey to the North was 2*90 = <<2*90=180>>180, twice the distance he took traveling to the East.\nThe whole journey took 130+180 = <<130+180=310>>310 miles.\n#### 310",
