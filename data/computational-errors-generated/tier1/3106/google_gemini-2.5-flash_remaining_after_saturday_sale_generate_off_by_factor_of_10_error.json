  "flawed_nl_solution": "Marta had 1000 kg of tomatoes on Friday and sold 300 kg on Saturday, so she has 1000 - 300 = <<1000-300=7000>>7000 kg of tomatoes left.\nOn Sunday 200 kg of tomatoes had to be thrown away, so 7000 - 200 = <<7000-200=6800>>6800 kg of tomatoes were left.\nThe shipment on Monday was twice the size of the first one, so it was 2 * 1000 = <<2*1000=2000>>2000 kg of tomatoes.\nThe total amount of tomatoes ready for sale on Tuesday was 6800 + 2000 = <<6800+2000=8800>>8800 kg.\n#### 8800",
