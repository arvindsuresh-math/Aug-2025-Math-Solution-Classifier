  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Mary first weighed 99 pounds, after she dropped a dozen pounds she weighed 99-12=<<99-12=78>>78 pounds.\nTwice the weight she initially lost is 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 pounds.\nSo, when she added back twice the weight that she initially lost, her weight jumped to 78+24=<<78+24=102>>102 pounds.\nThree times more than she initially had lost is 12*3=<<12*3=36>>36 pounds.\nTherefore, when Mary lost 3 times more than she initially lost, her weight dropped to 102-36=<<102-36=66>>66 pounds.\nFinally, when Mary gained back half of a dozen pounds, her final weight was 66+6=<<66+6=72>>72 pounds.\n#### 72",
