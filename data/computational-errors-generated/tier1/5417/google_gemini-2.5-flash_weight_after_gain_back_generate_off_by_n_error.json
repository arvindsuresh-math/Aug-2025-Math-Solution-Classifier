  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Mary first weighed 99 pounds, after she dropped a dozen pounds she weighed 99-12=<<99-12=87>>87 pounds.\nTwice the weight she initially lost is 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 pounds.\nSo, when she added back twice the weight that she initially lost, her weight jumped to 87+24=<<87+24=113>>113 pounds.\nThree times more than she initially had lost is 12*3=<<12*3=36>>36 pounds.\nTherefore, when Mary lost 3 times more than she initially lost, her weight dropped to 113-36=<<113-36=77>>77 pounds.\nFinally, when Mary gained back half of a dozen pounds, her final weight was 77+6=<<77+6=83>>83 pounds.\n#### 83",
