  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of shoes the factory made was 12000 dolls x 2 shoes/doll = <<12000*2=24000>>24000 shoes\nThe factory also made for each doll 12000 dolls x 3 bags/doll = <<12000*3=36000>>36000 bags\nThe set of cosmetics made for each doll was just one, so there are <<12000=21000>>21000 cosmetics sets\nFinally, the number of hats for the dolls was 12000 dolls x 5 hats/doll = <<12000*5=60000>>60000 hats\nIn total, the number of accessories was 24000 + 36000 + 21000 + 60000 = <<24000+36000+21000+60000=141000>>141000 accessories\nThe dolls took in total 12000 dolls x 45 seconds/doll = <<12000*45=540000>>540000 seconds to be made\nAll the accessories also took 141000 accessories x 10 seconds/accessory = <<141000*10=1410000>>1410000 seconds\nCombing both results, we have that the total time the machinery was working was 1410000 + 540000 = <<1410000+540000=1950000>>1950000 seconds\n#### 1950000",
