  "flawed_nl_solution": "Three times more wrinkles than three eyes is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 wrinkles.\nSeven times more spots than wrinkles is 7*9=<<7*9=36>>36 spots.\nTherefore, the combined number of spots and wrinkles on the lizard is 36+9=<<36+9=45>>45 spots and wrinkles.\nThus, the lizard has 45-3=42 fewer eyes than spots and wrinkles",
