  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first side with 4000 soldiers is eating 4000*10 = <<4000*10=40000>>40000 pounds of food every day.\nSince the other side has 500 soldiers fewer than the first side, there are 4000-500 = <<4000-500=3500>>3500 soldiers on the second side.\nSoldiers on the second side are each given 10-2 = <<10-2=9>>9 pounds of food.\nThe total amount of food the second side eats is 9*3500 = <<9*3500=31500>>31500\nAltogether, the two sides eat 31500+40000 = <<31500+40000=71500>>71500 pounds of food every day.\n#### 71500",
