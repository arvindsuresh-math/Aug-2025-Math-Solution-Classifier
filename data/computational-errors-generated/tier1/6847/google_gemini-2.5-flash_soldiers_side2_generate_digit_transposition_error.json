  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first side with 4000 soldiers is eating 4000*10 = <<4000*10=40000>>40000 pounds of food every day.\nSince the other side has 500 soldiers fewer than the first side, there are 4000-500 = <<4000-500=3050>>3050 soldiers on the second side.\nSoldiers on the second side are each given 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 pounds of food.\nThe total amount of food the second side eats is 8*3050 = <<8*3050=24400>>24400\nAltogether, the two sides eat 24400+40000 = <<24400+40000=64400>>64400 pounds of food every day.\n#### 64400",
