  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50*15=<<50*15=750>>750 feet.\nReleasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10*10=<<10*10=100>>100 feet.\nThe second 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50*15=<<50*15=570>>570 feet.\nThus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750-100+570=<<750-100+570=1220>>1220 feet above the earth's surface.\n#### 1220",
