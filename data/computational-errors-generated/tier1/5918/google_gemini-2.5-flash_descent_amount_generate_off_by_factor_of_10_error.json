  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50*15=<<50*15=750>>750 feet.\nReleasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10*10=<<10*10=1000>>1000 feet.\nThe second 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50*15=<<50*15=750>>750 feet.\nThus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750-1000+750=<<750-1000+750=500>>500 feet above the earth's surface.\n#### 500",
