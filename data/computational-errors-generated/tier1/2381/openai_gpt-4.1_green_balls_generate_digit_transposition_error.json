Green balls = 6 blue balls * 3 = <<6*3=81>>81 green balls\nThere are 2 times as many yellow balls as red ones so yellow balls = red balls * 2. Yellow balls = 4 red balls * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 yellow balls\nThe total number of all the balls is 6 blue + 4 red + 18 green + 8 yellow: 6+4+81+8 = <<6+4+81+8=99>>99 balls",
