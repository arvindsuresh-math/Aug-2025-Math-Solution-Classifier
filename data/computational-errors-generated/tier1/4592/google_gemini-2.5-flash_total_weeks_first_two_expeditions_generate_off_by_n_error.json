  "flawed_nl_solution": "If they spent 2 more weeks on their second research expedition than they spent on the first week, they spent 2+3 = <<2+3=5>>5 weeks on the island.\nIn the two expeditions, they stayed on the island for a total of 5+3 = <<5+3=12>>12 weeks.\nOn their third expedition, they spent twice as many weeks as they spent on the second week on the island, which is 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 weeks.\nIn all three expeditions, they stayed on the island for 10+12 = <<10+12=22>>22 weeks.\nSince a week has seven days, they spent 22*7 = <<22*7=154>>154 days on the island.\n#### 154",
