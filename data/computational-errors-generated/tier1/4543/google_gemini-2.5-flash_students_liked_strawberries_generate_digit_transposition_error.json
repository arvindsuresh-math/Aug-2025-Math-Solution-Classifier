  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, you have to add the number of students that liked the three other fruits. Therefore, you have to add 70 + 120 + 147. This gives you a sum of 337.\nWe know that 450 students were interviewed, so you have to subtract 337 from 450 to get the number of students who liked strawberries. 450 - 337 = <<450-337=131>>131 students liked strawberries best out of all of the fruits.\n#### 131",
