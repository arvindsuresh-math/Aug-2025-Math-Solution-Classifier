  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = <<50+2=25>>25 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 25+50 = <<25+50=75>>75 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 25*3 = <<25*3=75>>75 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 75+75 = <<75+75=150>>150 dolls.\n#### 150",
