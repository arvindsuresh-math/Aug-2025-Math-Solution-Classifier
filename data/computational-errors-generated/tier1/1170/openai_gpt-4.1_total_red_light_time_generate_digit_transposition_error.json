  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many minute Andy had to get to school when he left his house: 8:00 AM - 7:15 AM = 45 minutes\nThen find the total time he spent waiting at red lights: 3 minutes/light * 4 lights = <<3*4=21>>21 minutes\nNow add the normal travel time, red light time, and construction wait time to find Andy's total travel time: 30 minutes + 21 minutes + 10 minutes = <<30+21+10=61>>61 minutes\nNow subtract the amount of time Andy had when he left his house from that number to find how many minute late he is: 61 minutes - 45 minutes = <<61-45=16>>16 minutes",
