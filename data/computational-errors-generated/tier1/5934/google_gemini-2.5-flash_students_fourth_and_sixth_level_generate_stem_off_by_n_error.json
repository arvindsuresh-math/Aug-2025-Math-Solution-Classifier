  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Ms. Cole's sixth-level math class has 40 students and four times as many students in her fourth-level class, there are 4*40 = <<4*40=160>>160 in her fourth-level math class.\nFor the two levels, Ms. Cole teaches math to 160+40 = <<160+40=180>>180 students.\nIf the number of students in her seventh-level math class is twice that in the fourth-level math class, then she teaches 2*160 = <<2*160=320>>320 students in the seventh-level math class.\nMs. Cole teaches 320+180 = <<320+180=500>>500 math students in the school.\n#### 500",
