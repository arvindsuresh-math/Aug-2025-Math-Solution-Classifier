  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice Viggo's younger brother's age when his brother was 2 is 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 years.\nIf Viggo's age was 10 more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2, Viggo was 10+4 = 10 years old.\nViggo is 10 years - 2 years = <<10-2=8>>8 years older than his brother\nSince Viggo's brother is currently 10 and Vigo is 8 years older, he's currently 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 years old\nTheir combined age is 18 years + 10 years = <<18+10=28>>28 years",
