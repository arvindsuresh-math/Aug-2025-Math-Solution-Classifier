  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice Viggo's younger brother's age when his brother was 2 is 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 years.\nIf Viggo's age was 10 more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2, Viggo was 10+4 = 18 years old.\nViggo is 18 years - 2 years = <<18-2=16>>16 years older than his brother\nSince Viggo's brother is currently 10 and Vigo is 16 years older, he's currently 10 + 16 = <<10+16=26>>26 years old\nTheir combined age is 26 years + 10 years = <<26+10=36>>36 years",
