  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice Viggo's younger brother's age when his brother was 2 is 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 years.\nIf Viggo's age was 10 more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2, Viggo was 10+4 = 17 years old.\nViggo is 17 years - 2 years = <<17-2=15>>15 years older than his brother\nSince Viggo's brother is currently 10 and Vigo is 15 years older, he's currently 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25 years old\nTheir combined age is 25 years + 10 years = <<25+10=35>>35 years\n#### 35",
