  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice Viggo's younger brother's age when his brother was 2 is 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 years.\nIf Viggo's age was 10 more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2, Viggo was 10+4 = 12 years old.\nViggo is 12 years - 2 years = <<12-2=10>>10 years older than his brother\nSince Viggo's brother is currently 10 and Vigo is 10 years older, he's currently 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 years old\nTheir combined age is 20 years + 10 years = <<20+10=30>>30 years",
