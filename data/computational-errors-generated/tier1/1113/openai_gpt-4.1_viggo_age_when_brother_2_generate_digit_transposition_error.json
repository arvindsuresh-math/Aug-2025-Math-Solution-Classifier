  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice Viggo's younger brother's age when his brother was 2 is 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 years.\nIf Viggo's age was 10 more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2, Viggo was 10+4 = 41 years old.\nViggo is 41 years - 2 years = <<41-2=39>>39 years older than his brother\nSince Viggo's brother is currently 10 and Vigo is 39 years older, he's currently 10 + 39 = <<10+39=49>>49 years old\nTheir combined age is 49 years + 10 years = <<49+10=59>>59 years\n#### 59",
