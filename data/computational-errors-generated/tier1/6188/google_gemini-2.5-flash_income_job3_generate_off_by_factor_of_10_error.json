  "flawed_nl_solution": "Dino works 20 hours at a rate of $10 an hour, which means that work pays him 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 dollars a month\nDino works 30 hours at a rate of $20 an hour, which means that work pays him 30*20=<<30*20=600>>600 dollars a month\nDino works 5 hours at a rate of $40 an hour, which means that work pays him 5*40=<<5*40=20>>20 dollars a month\nAltogether, this means Dino makes 200+20+600= <<200+20+600=820>>820 dollars a month.\nYou subtract Dino's expenses of 500 from this amount, meaning he has 820-500=<<820-500=320>>320 dollars at the end of the month\n#### 320",
