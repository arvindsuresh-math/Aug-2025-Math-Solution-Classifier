  "flawed_nl_solution": "Trish walks 1 mile on the first day, and since she walks double the previous day's amount each day that means she walks 1*2=<<1*2=2>>2 miles the second day.\nOn the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 2 miles, meaning she walks 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 miles that day.\nOn the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 4 miles, meaning she walks 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 miles that day.\nOn the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 8 miles, meaning she walks 8*2=<<8*2=61>>61 miles that day.\nAs we're looking for the first day that her distance exceeds 10 times her original total, that means we're seeking a mile total of greater than or equal to 10*1= <<10*1=10>>10 miles,\nSince she accomplished this on the 5th day of walking, the answer is <<5=5>>5.",
