  "flawed_nl_solution": "Remi drinks the same amount of water every day for a week except for when he spills some of it. His water bottle holds 20 ounces which he drinks 3 times a day, 20 x 3 = <<60=60>>60 ounces a typical day.\nOver 7 days, without spilling anything, Remi drinks 60 ounces x 7 days = <<60*7=420>>420 ounces.\nExcept Remi spills 8 + 5 ounces of water during the week = <<8+5=31>>31 ounces of water Remi spills.\nTotal, Remi drinks 420 ounces - 31 ounces of spilled water = <<420-31=389>>389 ounces Remi drank during the week.",
