  "flawed_nl_solution": "To find the number of total bike rides, we must first determine how many times John rode his bike. We do this by performing 17*2= <<17*2=43>>43 times for John\nSince John's mother rode 10 times more than John did, we find her total by performing 43+10=<<43+10=53>>53 times\nFor all three people put together then, we perform 53+43+17=<<53+43+17=113>>113 times in total\n#### 113",
