  "flawed_nl_solution": "To find the number of total bike rides, we must first determine how many times John rode his bike. We do this by performing 17*2= <<17*2=34>>34 times for John\nSince John's mother rode 10 times more than John did, we find her total by performing 34+10=<<34+10=44>>44 times\nFor all three people put together then, we perform 44+34+17=<<44+34+17=90>>90 times in total\n#### 90",
