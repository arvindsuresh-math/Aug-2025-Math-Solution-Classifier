  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the population is halving then at the end of the third year, the population must have been 60 people in the fourth year * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 people.\nIn the second year, the population was 120 people in the third year * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 people.\nAnd in the first year, the population was 240 people in the third year * 2 = <<240*2=840>>840 people.\nAdditional people moved out in the first year, so accounting for these shows the population was 840 people + 400 people who moved out = <<840+400=1240>>1240 people.\nThen removing the new people shows there were originally 1240 people - 100 new people = <<1240-100=1140>>1140 people.\n#### 1140",
