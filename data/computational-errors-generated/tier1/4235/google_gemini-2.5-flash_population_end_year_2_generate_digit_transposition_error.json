  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the population is halving then at the end of the third year, the population must have been 60 people in the fourth year * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 people.\nIn the second year, the population was 120 people in the third year * 2 = <<120*2=204>>204 people.\nAnd in the first year, the population was 204 people in the third year * 2 = <<204*2=408>>408 people.\nAdditional people moved out in the first year, so accounting for these shows the population was 408 people + 400 people who moved out = <<408+400=808>>808 people.\nThen removing the new people shows there were originally 808 people - 100 new people = <<808-100=708>>708 people.\n#### 708",
