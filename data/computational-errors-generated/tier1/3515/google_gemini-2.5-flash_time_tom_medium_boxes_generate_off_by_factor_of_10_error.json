  "flawed_nl_solution": "If it takes Hugo twice the amount of time to fold a medium box than a small box, then he needs 2*3 = <<6=6>>6 seconds for the medium box\nIf there are 2400 small boxes and Hugo can fold 1 box in 3 seconds, then it would take him 2400*3 = <<2400*3=7200>>7200 seconds to fold all boxes\nIf there are 1800 medium boxes and Tom can fold 1 box in 4 seconds, then it would take him 1800*4 = <<1800*4=720>>720 seconds to fold all medium boxes\nGiven that they need the same amount of time to fold all boxes, and are doing it simultaneously they will need 7200 seconds to fold all the boxes\n#### 7200",
