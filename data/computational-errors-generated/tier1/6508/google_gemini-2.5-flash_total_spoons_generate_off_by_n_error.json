  "flawed_nl_solution": "From the baby spoons, Lisa holds 4 children * 3 spoons each = <<4*3=12>>12 baby spoons.\nAdding this to the decorative spoons means Lisa has 12 baby spoons + 2 decorative spoons = <<12+2=14>>14 old spoons.\nIn the new set of cutlery, there is a total of 10 large spoons + 15 teaspoons = <<10+15=25>>25 new spoons.\nSo in total, Lisa has 14 old spoons + 25 new spoons = <<14+25=42>>42 spoons.\n#### 42",
