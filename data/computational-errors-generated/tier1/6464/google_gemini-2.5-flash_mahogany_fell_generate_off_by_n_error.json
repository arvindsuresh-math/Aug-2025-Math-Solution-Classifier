  "flawed_nl_solution": "Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=80>>80 trees.\nIf there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 7 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon.\nSo, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees.\nShe also planted 7 trees x 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 Mahogany trees.\nSo, her mom planted 4 trees + 21 trees = <<4+21=25>>25 more trees.\nAfter the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = <<80-5=75>>75 trees left.\nTherefore, there are 75 trees + 25 trees = <<75+25=100>>100 trees now.\n#### 100",
