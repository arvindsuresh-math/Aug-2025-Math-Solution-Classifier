  "flawed_nl_solution": "Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=90>>90 trees.\nIf there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon.\nSo, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees.\nShe also planted 3 trees x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 Mahogany trees.\nSo, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = <<4+9=13>>13 more trees.\nAfter the typhoon, they only had 90 trees - 5 trees = <<90-5=85>>85 trees left.\nTherefore, there are 85 trees + 13 trees = <<85+13=98>>98 trees now.\n#### 98",
