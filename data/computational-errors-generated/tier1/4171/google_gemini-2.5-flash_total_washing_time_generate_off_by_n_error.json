  "flawed_nl_solution": "William spends 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = <<4+7+4+9=24>>24 minutes washing a normal car.\nHe washed 2 normal cars, so he spent 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 minutes on the normal cars.\nHe took twice as long as one car for the SUV, so he took 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 minutes on the SUV.\nThus, William spent 48 + 48 = <<48+48=94>>94 minutes washing all the vehicles.\n#### 94",
