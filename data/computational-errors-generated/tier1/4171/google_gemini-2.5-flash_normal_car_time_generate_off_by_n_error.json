  "flawed_nl_solution": "William spends 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = <<4+7+4+9=29>>29 minutes washing a normal car.\nHe washed 2 normal cars, so he spent 29 * 2 = <<29*2=58>>58 minutes on the normal cars.\nHe took twice as long as one car for the SUV, so he took 29 * 2 = <<29*2=58>>58 minutes on the SUV.\nThus, William spent 58 + 58 = <<58+58=116>>116 minutes washing all the vehicles.\n#### 116",
