  "flawed_nl_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = <<10*12=102>>102 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 102 + 6 = <<102+6=108>>108 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = <<6*12+22=94>>94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 108 - 94 = <<108-94=14>>14 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 14",
