  "flawed_nl_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = <<120+6=126>>126 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = <<6*12+22=49>>49 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 49 = <<126-49=77>>77 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 77",
