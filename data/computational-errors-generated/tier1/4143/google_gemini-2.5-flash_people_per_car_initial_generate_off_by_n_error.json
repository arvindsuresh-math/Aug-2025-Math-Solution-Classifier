  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 2 passengers and 1 driver in each car, which means that in each car there are 2 passengers + 1 driver = <<2+1=7>>7 people.\nThis means there are a total of 20 cars * 7 people per car = <<20*7=140>>140 people in the car at the start of the race.\nAt the halfway point, there is an additional 20 cars * 1 additional passenger = <<20*1=20>>20 more people.\nSo be the end of the race, there are 140 people at the start of the race + 20 additional people = <<140+20=160>>160 people in the cars.\n#### 160",
