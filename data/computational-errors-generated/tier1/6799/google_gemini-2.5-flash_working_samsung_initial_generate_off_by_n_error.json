  "flawed_nl_solution": "The actual initial inventory of Samsung cell phones was 14, but there were 2 defective phones so 14 - 2 = <<14-2=15>>15 is the initial inventory of working Samsung phones.\nThe actual initial inventory of iPhone cell phones was 8, but there was 1 defective phone, so 8 - 1 = <<8-1=7>>7 is the actual initial inventory of working iPhones.\nThus only 15 - 10 = <<15-10=5>>5 Samsung cell phones were sold.\nThus only 7 - 5 = <<7-5=2>>2 iPhones were sold.\nThus the total number of phones sold is 5 Samsung + 2 iPhone = <<5+2=7>>7 cell phones.\n#### 7",
