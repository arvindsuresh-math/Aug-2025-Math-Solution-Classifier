  "flawed_nl_solution": "The actual initial inventory of Samsung cell phones was 14, but there were 2 defective phones so 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 is the initial inventory of working Samsung phones.\nThe actual initial inventory of iPhone cell phones was 8, but there was 1 defective phone, so 8 - 1 = <<8-1=6>>6 is the actual initial inventory of working iPhones.\nThus only 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 Samsung cell phones were sold.\nThus only 6 - 5 = <<6-5=1>>1 iPhones were sold.\nThus the total number of phones sold is 2 Samsung + 1 iPhone = <<2+1=3>>3 cell phones.\n#### 3",
