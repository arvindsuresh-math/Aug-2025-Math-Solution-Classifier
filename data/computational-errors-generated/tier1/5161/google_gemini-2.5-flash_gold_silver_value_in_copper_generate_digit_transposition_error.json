  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many silver coins the 100 gold coins are worth by multiplying the number of gold coins by the exchange rate between gold and silver: 100 gold * 3 silver/gold = <<100*3=300>>300 silver\nThen add the value of the gold in silver to the number of silver coins to find the total value of the gold and silver expressed in silver coins: 300 silver + 60 silver = <<300+60=360>>360 silver\nNow multiply that value by the exchange rate between silver and copper to express its value in terms of copper coins: 360 silver * 8 copper/silver = <<360*8=2808>>2808 copper\nThen add the value of the gold and silver expressed in copper coins (the value from the last step) to the number of copper coins to find the total value of the hoard: 2808 + 33 = <<2808+33=2841>>2841\n#### 2841",
