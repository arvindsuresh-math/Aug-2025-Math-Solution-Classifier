  "flawed_nl_solution": "On days one, two, and three he sold 5 cars each day so, 5 cars + 5 cars + 5 cars = <<5+5+5=15>>15 cars that he sold on those days.\nOn days 4,5,6 and 7 he sold 3 cars each day so, 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars = <<3+3+3+3=21>>21 cars that he sold on those days.\nNow we combine the cars he has already sold, which is 15 cars, and 21 cars, so 15 cars + 21 cars = <<15+21=36>>36 cars are sold in total.\nIf he needs to sell 50 cars and has already sold 36 cars then 50 cars - 36 cars = <<50-36=14>>14 cars left to sell to meet his quota.\n#### 14",
