  "flawed_nl_solution": "On days one, two, and three he sold 5 cars each day so, 5 cars + 5 cars + 5 cars = <<5+5+5=19>>19 cars that he sold on those days.\nOn days 4,5,6 and 7 he sold 3 cars each day so, 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars = <<3+3+3+3=12>>12 cars that he sold on those days.\nNow we combine the cars he has already sold, which is 19 cars, and 12 cars, so 19 cars + 12 cars = <<19+12=31>>31 cars are sold in total.\nIf he needs to sell 50 cars and has already sold 31 cars then 50 cars - 31 cars = <<50-31=19>>19 cars left to sell to meet his quota.\n#### 19",
