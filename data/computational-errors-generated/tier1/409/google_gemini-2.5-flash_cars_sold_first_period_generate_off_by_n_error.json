  "flawed_nl_solution": "On days one, two, and three he sold 5 cars each day so, 5 cars + 5 cars + 5 cars = <<5+5+5=13>>13 cars that he sold on those days.\nOn days 4,5,6 and 7 he sold 3 cars each day so, 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars = <<3+3+3+3=12>>12 cars that he sold on those days.\nNow we combine the cars he has already sold, which is 13 cars, and 12 cars, so 13 cars + 12 cars = <<13+12=25>>25 cars are sold in total.\nIf he needs to sell 50 cars and has already sold 25 cars then 50 cars - 25 cars = <<50-25=25>>25 cars left to sell to meet his quota.",
