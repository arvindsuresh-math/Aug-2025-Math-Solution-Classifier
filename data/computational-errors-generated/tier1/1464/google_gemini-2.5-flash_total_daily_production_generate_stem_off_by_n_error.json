  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the company was producing 7000 toilet paper per day, when it ramped up its toilet paper production 3 times per day, it produced 3*7000 = 21000 more per day.\nThe total toilet production by the company increased to 7000+21000 = <<7000+21000=27990>>27990\nIn March, with 31 days, the company produced a total of 27990*31 = <<27990*31=867690>>867690 toilet papers",
