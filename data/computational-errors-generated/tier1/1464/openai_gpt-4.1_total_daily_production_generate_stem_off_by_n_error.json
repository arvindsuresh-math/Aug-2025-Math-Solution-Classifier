  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the company was producing 7000 toilet paper per day, when it ramped up its toilet paper production three times per day, it produced 3*7000 = 21000 more per day.\nThe total toilet production by the company increased to 7000+21000 = <<7000+21000=27970>>27970\nIn March, with 31 days, the company produced a total of 27970*31 = <<27970*31=867070>>867070 toilet papers",
