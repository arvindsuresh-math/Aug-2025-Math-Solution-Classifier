  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total cost of the drink tickets: 5 tickets * $7/ticket = $<<5*7=35>>35\nThen add that cost to the cost of the ticket to find the total cost: $35 + $181 = $<<35+181=216>>216\nThen multiply Jenna's hourly rate by the number of hours she works each week to find her weekly earnings: $18/hour * 30 hours/week = $<<18*30=450>>450/week\nThen multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works each month: $450/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<450*4=1800>>1800/month\nThen divide the cost of the concert by Jenna's monthly earnings and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: $216 / $1800 * 100% = 12%\n#### 12",
