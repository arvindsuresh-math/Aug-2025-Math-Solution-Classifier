  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total horse he owns is 5+3= <<5+3=8>>8.\nThe total liters of water each horse consumes is 5 + 2= <<5+2=7>>7.\nSo, the total water all the horses consume every day is 7 x 8 = <<7*8=56>>56.\nAnd the total of liters of water they consume every week is 56 x 7 = <<56*7=329>>329.\nTherefore, the total liters of water they consume for the entire month is 329 x 4= <<329*4=1316>>1316.\n#### 1316",
