  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total horse he owns is 5+3= <<5+3=4>>4.\nThe total liters of water each horse consumes is 5 + 2= <<5+2=7>>7.\nSo, the total water all the horses consume every day is 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28.\nAnd the total of liters of water they consume every week is 28 x 7 = <<28*7=196>>196.\nTherefore, the total liters of water they consume for the entire month is 196 x 4= <<196*4=784>>784.\n#### 784",
