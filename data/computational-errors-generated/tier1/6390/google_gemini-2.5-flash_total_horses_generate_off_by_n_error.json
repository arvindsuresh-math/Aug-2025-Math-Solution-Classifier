  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total horse he owns is 5+3= <<5+3=7>>7.\nThe total liters of water each horse consumes is 5 + 2= <<5+2=7>>7.\nSo, the total water all the horses consume every day is 7 x 7 = <<7*7=49>>49.\nAnd the total of liters of water they consume every week is 49 x 7 = <<49*7=343>>343.\nTherefore, the total liters of water they consume for the entire month is 343 x 4= <<343*4=1372>>1372.\n#### 1372",
