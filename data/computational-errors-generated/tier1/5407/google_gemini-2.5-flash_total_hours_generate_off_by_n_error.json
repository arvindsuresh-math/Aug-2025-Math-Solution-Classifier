  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine how many hours Jill studied in total. To find this out, we begin by performing 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 hours spent on day two, double what she spent on day 1.\nNext, we perform 4-1= <<4-1=3>>3 hours to determine the amount she studied on the third day.\nWe then add 2+4+3= <<2+4+3=4>>4 hours spent in total across 3 days.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, she studied 4*60=<<4*60=240>>240 minutes in total.\n#### 240",
