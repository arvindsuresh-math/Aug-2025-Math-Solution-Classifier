  "flawed_nl_solution": "The whole family consists of 4 + 2 + 1 = <<4+2+1=12>>12 persons.\nThe entrance ticket to the park costs the same for every person, so the family would need to pay 12 * 5 = $<<12*5=60>>60 to enter.\nFor visiting the attraction the tickets would cost 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8 for the kids.\nTheir parents and grandmother would need to pay 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nThat means a total cost for the family standing at 60 + 8 + 12 = $<<60+8+12=80>>80.",
