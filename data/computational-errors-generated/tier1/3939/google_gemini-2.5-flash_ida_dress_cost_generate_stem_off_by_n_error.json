  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jean's dress was $10 less than Pauline's $30 dress, meaning it was 30-10= <<30-10=20>>20 dollars.\nIda's dress was $30 more than Jean's $20 dress, meaning it was 30+20=<<30+20=20>>20 dollars.\nPatty's dress was $10 more than Ida's $20 dress, meaning it was 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30 dollars.\nTherefore, all four women together spent 30+20+20+30=<<30+20+20+30=100>>100 dollars.\n#### 100",
