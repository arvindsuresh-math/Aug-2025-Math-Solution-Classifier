  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jean's dress was $10 less than Pauline's $30 dress, meaning it was 30-10= <<30-10=20>>20 dollars.\nIda's dress was $30 more than Jean's $20 dress, meaning it was 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 dollars.\nPatty's dress was $10 more than Ida's $50 dress, meaning it was 50+10=<<50+10=80>>80 dollars.\nTherefore, all four women together spent 80+50+20+30=<<80+50+20+30=180>>180 dollars.\n#### 180",
