  "flawed_nl_solution": "The hairstylist earns $5 x 5 = $<<5*5=25>>25 for a normal haircut per day.\nHe earns $6 x 3 = $<<6*3=81>>81 for a special haircut.\nAnd he earns $8 x 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16 for a trendy haircut.\nSo, the total amount he earns per day is $25 + $81 + $16 = $<<25+81+16=122>>122.\nTherefore, a hairstylist earns $122 x 7= $<<122*7=854>>854 per month.",
