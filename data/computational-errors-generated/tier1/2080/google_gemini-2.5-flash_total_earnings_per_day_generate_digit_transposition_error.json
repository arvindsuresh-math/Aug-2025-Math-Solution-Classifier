  "flawed_nl_solution": "The hairstylist earns $5 x 5 = $<<5*5=25>>25 for a normal haircut per day.\nHe earns $6 x 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18 for a special haircut.\nAnd he earns $8 x 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16 for a trendy haircut.\nSo, the total amount he earns per day is $25 + $18 + $16 = $<<25+18+16=95>>95.\nTherefore, a hairstylist earns $95 x 7= $<<95*7=665>>665 per month.",
