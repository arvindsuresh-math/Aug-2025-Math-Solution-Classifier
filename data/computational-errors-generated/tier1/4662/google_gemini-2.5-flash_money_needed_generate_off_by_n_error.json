  "flawed_nl_solution": "If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14\nThis week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29\nIf we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94\nThe bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=4>>4 more that he will need to earn\n#### 4",
