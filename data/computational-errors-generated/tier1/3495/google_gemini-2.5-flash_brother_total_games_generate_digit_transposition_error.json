  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Louie scored 4 goals last night, his brother has scored 2 * 4 goals = <<4*2=8>>8 goals in each game\nThe total number of games Louie's brother has played in is 3 seasons * 50 games/season = <<3*50=510>>510 games\nLouie's brother's total number of goals in the three seasons is 8 goals/game * 510 games = <<8*510=4080>>4080 goals.\nLouie's total number of goals this season is 40 goals + 4 goals = <<40+4=44>>44 goals\nTogether, they have a total of 44 goals + 4080 goals = <<44+4080=4124>>4124 goals in the team\n#### 4124",
