  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Louie scored 4 goals last night, his brother has scored 2 * 4 goals = <<4*2=8>>8 goals in each game\nThe total number of games Louie's brother has played in is 3 seasons * 50 games/season = <<3*50=150>>150 games\nLouie's brother's total number of goals in the three seasons is 8 goals/game * 150 games = <<8*150=1200>>1200 goals.\nLouie's total number of goals this season is 40 goals + 4 goals = <<40+4=44>>44 goals\nTogether, they have a total of 44 goals + 1200 goals = <<44+1200=1424>>1424 goals in the team\n#### 1424",
