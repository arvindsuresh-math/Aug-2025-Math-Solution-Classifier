  "flawed_nl_solution": "First we find how many cookies Betty will eat in a week by multiplying her daily amount by 7, meaning 7*3=<<21=21>>21 cookies eaten in a week.\nWe repeat this for the brownies, finding she eats 7*1=<<7*1=7>>7 brownies in a week.\nWe subtract the 21 cookies from the original amount of 60, finding 60-21= <<60-21=34>>34 cookies remaining.\nWe repeat this step for the brownies, finding 10-7= <<10-7=3>>3 brownies remaining.\nIn the end, therefore, Betty has 34-3= <<34-3=31>>31 more cookies than brownies.\n#### 31",
