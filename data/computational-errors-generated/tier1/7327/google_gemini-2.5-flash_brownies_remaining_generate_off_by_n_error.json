  "flawed_nl_solution": "First we find how many cookies Betty will eat in a week by multiplying her daily amount by 7, meaning 7*3=<<21=21>>21 cookies eaten in a week.\nWe repeat this for the brownies, finding she eats 7*1=<<7*1=7>>7 brownies in a week.\nWe subtract the 21 cookies from the original amount of 60, finding 60-21= <<60-21=39>>39 cookies remaining.\nWe repeat this step for the brownies, finding 10-7= <<10-7=1>>1 brownies remaining.\nIn the end, therefore, Betty has 39-1= <<39-1=38>>38 more cookies than brownies.\n#### 38",
