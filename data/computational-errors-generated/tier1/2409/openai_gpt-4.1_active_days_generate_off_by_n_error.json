  "flawed_nl_solution": "June has 30 days, so if they didn't play any songs on weekends, then they played 30 days - 8 days = <<30-8=24>>24 days.\nIf Vivian played 10 songs each day, the total number of songs she played for the month is 10 songs/day * 24 days = <<10*24=240>>240 songs.\nClara played 2 fewer songs, which is 10 songs/day - 2 songs/day = <<10-2=8>>8 songs/day.\nThe total number of songs played by Clara for the whole month is 8 songs/day * 24 days = <<8*24=192>>192 songs.\nThe total played by both is 240 songs + 192 songs = <<240+192=432>>432 songs",
