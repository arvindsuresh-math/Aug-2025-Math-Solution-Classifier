  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, figure out how much punch was left in the bowl before Mark refilled it by subtracting the 12 gallons he added from the bowl's total capacity: 16 - 12 = <<16-12=9>>9 gallons\nNext, figure out how much punch was in the bowl before Sally came along: 9 + 2 = <<9+2=11>>11 gallons.\nNext, figure out how much punch was in the bowl before Mark started to refill it: 11 - 4 = <<11-4=7>>7 gallons\nFinally, multiply that amount by 2 to find out how much punch there was before the cousin drank half: 7 * 2 = <<14=14>>14 gallons\n#### 14",
