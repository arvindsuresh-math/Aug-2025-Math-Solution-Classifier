  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, figure out how much punch was left in the bowl before Mark refilled it by subtracting the 12 gallons he added from the bowl's total capacity: 16 - 12 = <<16-12=4>>4 gallons\nNext, figure out how much punch was in the bowl before Sally came along: 4 + 2 = <<4+2=7>>7 gallons.\nNext, figure out how much punch was in the bowl before Mark started to refill it: 7 - 4 = <<7-4=3>>3 gallons\nFinally, multiply that amount by 2 to find out how much punch there was before the cousin drank half: 3 * 2 = <<6=6>>6 gallons\n#### 6",
