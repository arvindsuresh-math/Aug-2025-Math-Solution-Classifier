  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, figure out how much punch was left in the bowl before Mark refilled it by subtracting the 12 gallons he added from the bowl's total capacity: 16 - 12 = <<16-12=4>>4 gallons\nNext, figure out how much punch was in the bowl before Sally came along: 4 + 2 = <<4+2=8>>8 gallons.\nNext, figure out how much punch was in the bowl before Mark started to refill it: 8 - 4 = <<8-4=4>>4 gallons\nFinally, multiply that amount by 2 to find out how much punch there was before the cousin drank half: 4 * 2 = <<8=8>>8 gallons\n#### 8",
