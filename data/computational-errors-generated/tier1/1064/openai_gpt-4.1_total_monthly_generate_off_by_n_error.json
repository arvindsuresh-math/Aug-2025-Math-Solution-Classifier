  "flawed_nl_solution": "He spends $10/snake * 4 snakes = $<<10*4=40>>40 to feed his snakes every month\nHe spends $5/iguana * 2 iguanas = $<<5*2=10>>10 to feed his iguanas every month\nHe spends $15/gecko * 3 geckos = $<<15*3=45>>45 to feed his geckos every month\nSo overall he spends $40 + $10 + $45 = $<<40+10+45=99>>99 to feed all his pets every month\nTherefore every year pet food costs him $99/month * 12 months = $<<99*12=1188>>1188",
