  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons.\nIf Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons.\nTherefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=19>>19 gallons.\nIn three trips, that means they would move a total of 19*3=<<19*3=57>>57 gallons\n#### 57",
