  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=7>>7 gallons.\nIf Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 7-gallon pail, that means it holds 7*2=<<7*2=14>>14 gallons.\nTherefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+7+14=<<4+7+14=25>>25 gallons.\nIn three trips, that means they would move a total of 25*3=<<25*3=75>>75 gallons\n#### 75",
