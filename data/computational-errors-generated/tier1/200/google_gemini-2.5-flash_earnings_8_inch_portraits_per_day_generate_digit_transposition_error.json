  "flawed_nl_solution": "Sansa earns $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=51>>51 every day by selling three 8-inch portraits.\nThe price of the 16-inch portrait is $5 x 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 each.\nSo, she earns $10 x 5 = $<<10*5=50>>50 every day by selling five 16-inch portraits.\nHer total earnings is $50 + $51 = $<<50+51=101>>101 every day.\nTherefore, the total amount she earns after 3 days is $101 x 3 = $<<101*3=303>>303.\n#### 303",
