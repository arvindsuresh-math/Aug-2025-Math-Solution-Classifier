  "flawed_nl_solution": "On Wednesday, Liza had $800 - $450 = $<<800-450=350>>350 left in her account.\nAfter depositing on Thursday, she had $350 + $1500 = $<<350+1500=1850>>1850 in her account.\nOn Friday, she paid a total of $117 + $100 = $<<117+100=127>>127 for her electricity and internet bills.\nSo, $1850 - $127 = $<<1850-127=1723>>1723 was left on her account on Friday.\nAfter paying her phone bill, Liza has $1723 - $70 = $<<1723-70=1653>>1653 left in her account.\n#### 1653",
