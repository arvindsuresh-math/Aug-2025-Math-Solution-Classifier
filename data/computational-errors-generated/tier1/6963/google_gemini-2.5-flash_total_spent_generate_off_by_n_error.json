  "flawed_nl_solution": "To find out how much the saleswoman should give her back, we have to find out first how much she spent. She bought apples for 5\u20ac, sugar for 3\u20ac and carrots for 17\u20ac, so she spent 5\u20ac + 3\u20ac +17\u20ac = <<5+3+17=22>>22\u20ac.\nShe pays 50\u20ac and the saleswoman must keep 22\u20ac, so the seller must give her back 50\u20ac - 22\u20ac = <<50-22=28>>28\u20ac\n#### 28",
