  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many hours total Jake works by adding the time spent mowing the lawn to the time spent planting flowers: 1 hour + 2 hours = <<1+2=6>>6 hours\nThen figure out how much money Jake makes if he earns $20/hour for three hours by multiplying the time spent by the pay rate: $20/hour * 6 hours = $<<20*6=120>>120\nThen subtract the money Jake gets paid for mowing the lawn from the total to find how much he should charge in total for planting the flowers: $120 - $15 = $<<120-15=105>>105\n#### 105",
