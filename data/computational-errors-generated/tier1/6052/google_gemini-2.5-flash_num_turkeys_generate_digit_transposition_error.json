  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Valentino has twice as many ducks as chicken on his farm, which means there are 2*200 = <<2*200=400>>400 ducks on the farm.\nThe number of turkeys is three times as many as the number of ducks on Mr. Valentino's farm, a total of 3*400 = <<3*400=2100>>2100 turkeys.\nIn total, Mr. Valentino has 2100+400 = <<2100+400=2500>>2500 ducks and turkeys on his farm.\nIf you add the number of chickens on the farm, the number of birds on the farm becomes 2500+200 = <<2500+200=2700>>2700 birds.\n#### 2700",
