  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Valentino has twice as many ducks as chicken on his farm, which means there are 2*200 = <<2*200=4000>>4000 ducks on the farm.\nThe number of turkeys is three times as many as the number of ducks on Mr. Valentino's farm, a total of 3*4000 = <<3*4000=12000>>12000 turkeys.\nIn total, Mr. Valentino has 12000+4000 = <<12000+4000=16000>>16000 ducks and turkeys on his farm.\nIf you add the number of chickens on the farm, the number of birds on the farm becomes 16000+200 = <<16000+200=16200>>16200 birds.\n#### 16200",
