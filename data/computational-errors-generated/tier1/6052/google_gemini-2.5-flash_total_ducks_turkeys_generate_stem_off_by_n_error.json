  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Valentino has twice as many ducks as chicken on his farm, which means there are 2*200 = <<2*200=400>>400 ducks on the farm.\nThe number of turkeys is three times as many as the number of ducks on Mr. Valentino's farm, a total of 3*400 = <<3*400=1200>>1200 turkeys.\nIn total, Mr. Valentino has 1200+400 = <<1200+400=1590>>1590 ducks and turkeys on his farm.\nIf you add the number of chickens on the farm, the number of birds on the farm becomes 1590+200 = <<1590+200=1790>>1790 birds.\n#### 1790",
