  "flawed_nl_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 miles to school in one week.\nThe supermarket is 10 miles farther away than the school. Therefore the supermarket is 10 + 10 = <<10+10=15>>15 miles away from Laura's house\nLaura drives 15 miles each way to and from the supermarket. Each trip is 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 miles.\nLaura drives 30 miles twice a week to visit the supermarket. Therefore she drives 30 x 2 =<<30*2=60>>60 miles in total a week to and from the supermarket.\nIn total Laura drives 140 + 60 = <<140+60=200>>200 miles each week.\n#### 200",
