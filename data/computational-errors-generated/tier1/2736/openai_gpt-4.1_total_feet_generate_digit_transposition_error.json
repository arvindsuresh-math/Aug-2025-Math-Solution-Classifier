  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Paul makes 3 trips per day, and each trip involves going both down and up, this means he travels the full vertical distance of his apartment complex 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times a day.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, this means he makes this trip 6*7=42 times a week.\nSince each story is 10 feet tall, that means with 5 stories he travels 5*10= <<5*10=50>>50 feet each trip.\nSince he made 42 trips of 50 feet each, this means he traveled 50*42= <<50*42=1200>>1200 feet in a week.",
