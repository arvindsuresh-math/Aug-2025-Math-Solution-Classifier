  "flawed_nl_solution": "Paul doubles the amount that he ate on the second day, so eats 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 sandwiches.\nFor the third day, he doubles the number of sandwiches he ate on the second day, so eats 2 x 2 x 2 = <<2*2*2=8>>8 sandwiches.\nTo get the total amount of sandwiches he ate over three days it's necessary to add up the amount he ate each day: 2 + 4 + 8 = <<2+4+8=16>>16 sandwiches\nSince he eats 16 sandwiches every 3 days, then in 6 days he would eat 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 sandwiches in total.\n#### 32",
