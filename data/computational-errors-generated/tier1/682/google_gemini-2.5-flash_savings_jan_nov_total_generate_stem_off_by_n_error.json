  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since there are 7 months from January to July, then Roe's savings for those months sum up to $10 x 7 = $<<7*10=70>>70.\nSince there are 4 months from August to November, then her savings for those months sum up to $15 x 4 = $<<4*15=60>>60.\nHer total savings from January to November is $70 + $60 = $<<70+60=110>>110.\nTherefore, she needs to save $150 - $110 = $<<150-110=40>>40 in December.\n#### 40",
