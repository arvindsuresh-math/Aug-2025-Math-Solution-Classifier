  "flawed_nl_solution": "If on the return journey to its home, the alligator took 2 more hours than it took to travel to the Nile Delta, Paul took 4+2=<<4+2=10>>10 hours to travel back to its home.\nThe total time Paul took to travel from its home to the Nile Delta and back is 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14\nOn his return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and since each alligator traveled for six hours up the Nile to their home, they took a total of 6*10=<<6*10=60>>60 hours to do so.\nTogether with Paul, all the alligators took 14+60=<<14+60=74>>74 hours traveling between Nile Delta and up the Nile.",
