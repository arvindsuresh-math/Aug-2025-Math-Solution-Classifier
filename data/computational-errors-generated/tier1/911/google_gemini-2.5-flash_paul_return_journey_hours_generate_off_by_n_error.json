  "flawed_nl_solution": "If on the return journey to its home, the alligator took 2 more hours than it took to travel to the Nile Delta, Paul took 4+2=<<4+2=2>>2 hours to travel back to its home.\nThe total time Paul took to travel from its home to the Nile Delta and back is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6\nOn his return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and since each alligator traveled for 2 hours up the Nile to their home, they took a total of 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 hours to do so.\nTogether with Paul, all the alligators took 6+12=<<6+12=18>>18 hours traveling between Nile Delta and up the Nile.\n#### 18",
