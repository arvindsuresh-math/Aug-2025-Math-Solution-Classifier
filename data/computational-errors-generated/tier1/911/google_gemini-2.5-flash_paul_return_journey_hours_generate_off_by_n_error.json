  "flawed_nl_solution": "If on the return journey to its home, the alligator took 2 more hours than it took to travel to the Nile Delta, Paul took 4+2=<<4+2=5>>5 hours to travel back to its home.\nThe total time Paul took to travel from its home to the Nile Delta and back is 5+4=<<5+4=9>>9\nOn his return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and since each alligator traveled for 5 hours up the Nile to their home, they took a total of 6*5=<<6*5=30>>30 hours to do so.\nTogether with Paul, all the alligators took 9+30=<<9+30=39>>39 hours traveling between Nile Delta and up the Nile.\n#### 39",
