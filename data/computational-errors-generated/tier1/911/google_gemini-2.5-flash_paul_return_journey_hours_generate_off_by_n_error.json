  "flawed_nl_solution": "If on the return journey to its home, the alligator took 2 more hours than it took to travel to the Nile Delta, Paul took 4+2=<<4+2=7>>7 hours to travel back to its home.\nThe total time Paul took to travel from its home to the Nile Delta and back is 7+4=<<7+4=11>>11\nOn his return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and since each alligator traveled for 7 hours up the Nile to their home, they took a total of 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 hours to do so.\nTogether with Paul, all the alligators took 11+42=<<11+42=53>>53 hours traveling between Nile Delta and up the Nile.",
