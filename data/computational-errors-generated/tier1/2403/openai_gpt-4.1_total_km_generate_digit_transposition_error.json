  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Onur bikes 250 kilometers in a day, he bikes 5*250 = <<250*5=1250>>1250 kilometers for five days in a week.\nOnur's friend Hanil bikes 40 more kilometers in a day than Onur, meaning he bikes for 250+40 = <<250+40=290>>290 kilometers.\nIn five days of the week, Hanil covers 290*5 = <<290*5=1450>>1450 kilometers.\nIn total, the two bikes for 1450+1250 = <<1450+1250=2070>>2070 kilometers in 5 days of a week.\n#### 2070",
