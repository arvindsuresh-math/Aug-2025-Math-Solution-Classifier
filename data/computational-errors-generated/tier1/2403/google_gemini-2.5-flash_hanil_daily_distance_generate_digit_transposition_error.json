  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Onur bikes 250 kilometers in a day, he bikes 5*250 = <<250*5=1250>>1250 kilometers for five days in a week.\nOnur's friend Hanil bikes 40 more kilometers in a day than Onur, meaning he bikes for 250+40 = <<250+40=920>>920 kilometers.\nIn five days of the week, Hanil covers 920*5 = <<920*5=4600>>4600 kilometers.\nIn total, the two bikes for 4600+1250 = <<4600+1250=5850>>5850 kilometers in 5 days of a week.\n#### 5850",
