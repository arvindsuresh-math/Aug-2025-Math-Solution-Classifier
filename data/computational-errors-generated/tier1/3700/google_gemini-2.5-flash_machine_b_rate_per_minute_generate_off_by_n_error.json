  "flawed_nl_solution": "Machine A can put caps on 12 x 10 = <<12*10=120>>120 bottles in 10 minutes.\nMachine B can put caps on 12 - 2 = <<12-2=5>>5 bottles in 1 minute.\nSo in 10 minutes, machine B can put caps on 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 bottles.\nMachine c can put caps on 5 + 5 = <<5+5=10>>10 bottles in 1 minute.\nSo in 10 minutes, machine C can put caps on 10 x 10 = <<10*10=100>>100 bottles.\nTherefore, the three machines can put caps on 120 + 50 + 100 = <<120+50+100=270>>270 bottles in 10 minutes.\n#### 270",
