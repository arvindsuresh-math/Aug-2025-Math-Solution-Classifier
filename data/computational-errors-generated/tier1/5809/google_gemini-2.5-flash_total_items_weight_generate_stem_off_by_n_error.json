  "flawed_nl_solution": "Daryl can load up to 15 crates * 20kg per crate = <<15*20=300>>300kg.\nThe nails weigh a total of 4 bags of nails * 5kg per bag of nails = <<4*5=20>>20kg.\nThe hammers weigh a total of 12 bags of hammers * 5kg per bag of hammers = <<12*5=60>>60kg.\nThe wooden planks weigh a total of 10 bags of wooden planks * 30kg per bag of wooden planks= <<10*30=300>>300kg.\nSo in total, Daryl's items weigh a total of 20kg nails + 60kg hammers + 300kg wooden planks = <<20+60+300=400>>400kg.\nHe will therefore need to leave out 400kg in items - 300kg weight limit = <<400-300=100>>100kg.\n#### 100",
