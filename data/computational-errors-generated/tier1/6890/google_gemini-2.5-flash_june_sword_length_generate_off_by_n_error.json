  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice the length of Christopher's sword is 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 inches.\nSo, Jameson's sword is 30 + 3 = <<30+3=33>>33 inches long.\nJune's sword is 33 + 5 = <<33+5=40>>40 inches long.\nThus, June's sword is 40 - 15 = <<40-15=25>>25 inches longer than Christopher's sword.\n#### 25",
