  "flawed_nl_solution": "The electronics store sold 327 televisions this Black Friday and might sell 50 more televisions the next year, for a total of 327 + 50 = <<327+50=378>>378 televisions.\nThe second year they might sell 378 + 50 = <<378+50=428>>428 televisions.\nThe third year, if they continue to sell 50 more televisions than they did the previous year, they will sell 428 + 50 televisions = <<428+50=478>>478 televisions on the Black Friday three years from now.\n#### 478",
