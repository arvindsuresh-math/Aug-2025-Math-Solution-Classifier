  "flawed_nl_solution": "The electronics store sold 327 televisions this Black Friday and might sell 50 more televisions the next year, for a total of 327 + 50 = <<327+50=380>>380 televisions.\nThe second year they might sell 380 + 50 = <<380+50=430>>430 televisions.\nThe third year, if they continue to sell 50 more televisions than they did the previous year, they will sell 430 + 50 televisions = <<430+50=480>>480 televisions on the Black Friday three years from now.\n#### 480",
