  "flawed_nl_solution": "The area of the whole front yard is 200 feet by 50 feet, or 200 ft * 50 ft = <<200*50=10000>>10000 sq.ft.\nThe sidewalk is 3 feet by 50 feet, or 3ft * 50ft = <<3*50=510>>510 sq.ft.\nEach of the flower beds right in front of the house is 4 feet by 25 feet, or 4 ft * 25 ft = 100 sq.ft. There are 2, so that's 2 * 100 sq.ft. = 200 sq.ft.\nThe third flower bed is 10 feet by 12 feet, or 10ft * 12ft = <<10*12=120>>120 sq.ft.\nThe fourth flower bed is 7 feet by 8 feet, or 7ft * 8ft = <<7*8=56>>56 sq.ft.\nThe total area of the sidewalk and flower beds is 510 sq.ft + 200 sq.ft + 120 sq.ft + 56 sq.ft = <<510+200+120+56=886>>886 sq. ft.\nSo Jill will need a total of 10000 sq.ft - 886 sq.ft = <<10000-886=9114>>9114 sq.ft. of sod.\n#### 9114",
