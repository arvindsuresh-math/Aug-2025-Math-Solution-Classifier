  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mitch earns 5 x $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 every weekday.\nSo, she earns $15 x 5 = $<<15*5=75>>75 from Monday to Friday.\nAnd she earns $3 x 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 per hour every weekend.\nHence, the total amount she earns every weekend is $6 x 3= $<<6*3=18>>18.\nSo, she earns $18 x 2 = $<<18*2=36>>36 every Saturday and Sunday.\nTherefore, the total amount she earns every week is $75 + $36= $<<75+36=114>>114.\n#### 114",
