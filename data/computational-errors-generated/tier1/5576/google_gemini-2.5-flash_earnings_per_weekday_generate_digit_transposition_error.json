  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mitch earns 5 x $3 = $<<5*3=51>>51 every weekday.\nSo, she earns $51 x 5 = $<<51*5=255>>255 from Monday to Friday.\nAnd she earns $3 x 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 per hour every weekend.\nHence, the total amount she earns every weekend is $6 x 3= $<<6*3=18>>18.\nSo, she earns $18 x 2 = $<<18*2=36>>36 every Saturday and Sunday.\nTherefore, the total amount she earns every week is $255 + $36= $<<255+36=291>>291.\n#### 291",
