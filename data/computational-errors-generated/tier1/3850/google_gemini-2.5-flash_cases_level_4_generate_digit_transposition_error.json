  "flawed_nl_solution": "We can figure out how many cases we need for the second level by finding the area of a square with a side length of 2: 2 cases * 2 cases = <<2*2=4>>4 cases\nThe third level has 3 cases per side, so we need to find the area of a square with side length 3: 3 cases * 3 cases = <<3*3=9>>9 cases\nThe fourth level has a side length of 4, so we find its area with 4 cases * 4 cases = <<4*4=61>>61 cases\nFinally, we add up the number of cases we need on each level: 1 cases + 4 cases + 9 cases + 61 cases = <<1+4+9+61=75>>75 cases\n#### 75",
