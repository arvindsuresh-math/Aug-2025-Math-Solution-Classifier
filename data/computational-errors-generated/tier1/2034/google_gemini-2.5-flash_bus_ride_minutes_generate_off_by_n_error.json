  "flawed_nl_solution": "Removing the time of the train ride from the journey shows that his trip to get on the train took him 8 hours \u2013 6 hours = <<8-6=2>>2 hours.\nConverting this time into minutes shows that getting to the train took 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nWaiting for the train to arrive took twice as long as his walk, so 15 minutes * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 minutes.\nThis means that his bus ride must have taken 120 minutes \u2013 30 minutes - 15 minutes = <<120-30-15=80>>80 minutes.\n#### 80",
