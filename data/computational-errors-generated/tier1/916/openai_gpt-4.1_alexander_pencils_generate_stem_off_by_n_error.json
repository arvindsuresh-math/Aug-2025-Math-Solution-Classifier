  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the sum of their ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old, Alexander is 140-50 = <<140-50=90>>90 years old.\nThe age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is 90-50 = <<90-50=40>>40\nSince the age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is half the total number of pencils Asaf has, Asaf has 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 pencils.\nIf Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, Alexander has 80+60= <<60+80=120>>120 pencils.\nTogether, they have 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 pencils",
