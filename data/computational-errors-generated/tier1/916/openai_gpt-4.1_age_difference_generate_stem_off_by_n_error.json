  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the sum of their ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old, Alexander is 140-50 = <<140-50=90>>90 years old.\nThe age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is 90-50 = <<90-50=10>>10\nSince the age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is half the total number of pencils Asaf has, Asaf has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 pencils.\nIf Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, Alexander has 20+60= <<60+20=80>>80 pencils.\nTogether, they have 80 + 20 = <<80+20=100>>100 pencils\n#### 100",
