  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the sum of their ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old, Alexander is 140-50 = <<140-50=90>>90 years old.\nThe age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is 90-50 = <<90-50=50>>50\nSince the age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is half the total number of pencils Asaf has, Asaf has 2*50 = <<2*50=100>>100 pencils.\nIf Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, Alexander has 100+60= <<60+100=160>>160 pencils.\nTogether, they have 160 + 100 = <<160+100=260>>260 pencils",
