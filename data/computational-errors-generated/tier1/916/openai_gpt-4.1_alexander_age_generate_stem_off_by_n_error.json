  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the sum of their ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old, Alexander is 140-50 = <<140-50=70>>70 years old.\nThe age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is 70-50 = <<70-50=20>>20\nSince the age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is half the total number of pencils Asaf has, Asaf has 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40 pencils.\nIf Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, Alexander has 40+60= <<60+40=100>>100 pencils.\nTogether, they have 100 + 40 = <<100+40=140>>140 pencils",
