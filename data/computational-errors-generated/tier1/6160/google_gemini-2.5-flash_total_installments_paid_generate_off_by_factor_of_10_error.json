  "flawed_nl_solution": "When Samantha paid $300 in 30 equal monthly installments, she paid a total of $<<300*30=90000>>90000\nSince the higher purchase is a deposit plus the total monthly installments, Samatha paid $3000+$90000=$<<3000+90000=93000>>93000 for the refrigerator on higher purchase.\nIf she would have bought the refrigerator on the cash prize, Samantha would have paid $93000- to $8000= $<<93000-8000=85000>>85000 less.\n#### 85000",
