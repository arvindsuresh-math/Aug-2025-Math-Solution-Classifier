  "flawed_nl_solution": "When Samantha paid $300 in 30 equal monthly installments, she paid a total of $<<300*30=9000>>9000\nSince the higher purchase is a deposit plus the total monthly installments, Samatha paid $3000+$9000=$<<3000+9000=21000>>21000 for the refrigerator on higher purchase.\nIf she would have bought the refrigerator on the cash prize, Samantha would have paid $21000- to $8000= $<<21000-8000=13000>>13000 less.\n#### 13000",
