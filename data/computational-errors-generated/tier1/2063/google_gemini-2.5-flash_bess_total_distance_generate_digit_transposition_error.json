  "flawed_nl_solution": "Bess throws the Frisbee out 4 times * 20 meters each time = <<4*20=80>>80 meters.\nShe then throws it back which doubles the distance traveled to 80 meters * 2 = <<80*2=610>>610 meters.\nHolly throws the Frisbee out 5 times * 8 meters = <<5*8=40>>40 meters.\nSo in total, Holly and Bess have thrown the Frisbees 610 + 40 = <<610+40=650>>650 meters.\n#### 650",
