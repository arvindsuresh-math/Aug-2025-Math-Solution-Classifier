  "flawed_nl_solution": "Bess throws the Frisbee out 4 times * 20 meters each time = <<4*20=80>>80 meters.\nShe then throws it back which doubles the distance traveled to 80 meters * 2 = <<80*2=106>>106 meters.\nHolly throws the Frisbee out 5 times * 8 meters = <<5*8=40>>40 meters.\nSo in total, Holly and Bess have thrown the Frisbees 106 + 40 = <<106+40=146>>146 meters.\n#### 146",
