If she will be using the same shirt for 2 days then she will need clothes for 7 - 2 = <<7-2=3>>3 days\nBecause she wants to use 2 different shirts each of those 3 days then she needs 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 shirts\nIn total she will need 6 shirts between Tuesday and Saturday and 1 shirt for Monday and Sunday = <<6+1=7>>7 shirts\n#### 7",
