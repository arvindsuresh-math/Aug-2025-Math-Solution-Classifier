If she will be using the same shirt for 2 days then she will need clothes for 7 - 2 = <<7-2=1>>1 days\nBecause she wants to use 2 different shirts each of those 1 days then she needs 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 shirts\nIn total she will need 2 shirts between Tuesday and Saturday and 1 shirt for Monday and Sunday = <<2+1=3>>3 shirts\n#### 3",
