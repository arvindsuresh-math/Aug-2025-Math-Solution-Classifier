If she will be using the same shirt for 2 days then she will need clothes for 7 - 2 = <<7-2=9>>9 days\nBecause she wants to use 2 different shirts each of those 9 days then she needs 2 * 9 = <<2*9=18>>18 shirts\nIn total she will need 18 shirts between Tuesday and Saturday and 1 shirt for Monday and Sunday = <<18+1=19>>19 shirts\n#### 19",
