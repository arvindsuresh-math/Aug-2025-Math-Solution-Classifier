  "flawed_nl_solution": "Between Monday and Sunday there are 7 days. If she will be using the same shirt for 2 days then she will need clothes for 7 - 2 = <<7-2=10>>10 days\nBecause she wants to use 2 different shirts each of those 10 days then she needs 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 shirts\nIn total she will need 20 shirts between Tuesday and Saturday and 1 shirt for Monday and Sunday = <<20+1=21>>21 shirts",
