If she will be using the same shirt for 2 days then she will need clothes for 7 - 2 = <<7-2=2>>2 days\nBecause she wants to use 2 different shirts each of those 2 days then she needs 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 shirts\nIn total she will need 4 shirts between Tuesday and Saturday and 1 shirt for Monday and Sunday = <<4+1=5>>5 shirts",
