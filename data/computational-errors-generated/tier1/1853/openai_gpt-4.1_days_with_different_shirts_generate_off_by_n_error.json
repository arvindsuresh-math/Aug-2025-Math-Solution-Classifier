If she will be using the same shirt for 2 days then she will need clothes for 7 - 2 = <<7-2=8>>8 days\nBecause she wants to use 2 different shirts each of those 8 days then she needs 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 shirts\nIn total she will need 16 shirts between Tuesday and Saturday and 1 shirt for Monday and Sunday = <<16+1=17>>17 shirts",
