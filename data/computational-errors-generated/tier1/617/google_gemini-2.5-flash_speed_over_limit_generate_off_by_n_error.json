  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=40>>40 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 40 mph = $<<2*40=80>>80\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $80 + $50 = $<<80+50=130>>130\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $130 * 2 = $<<130*2=260>>260\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $260 = $<<240+300+260=800>>800\n#### 800",
