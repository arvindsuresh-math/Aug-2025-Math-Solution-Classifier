  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=43>>43 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 43 mph = $<<2*43=86>>86\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $86 + $50 = $<<86+50=136>>136\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $136 * 2 = $<<136*2=272>>272\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $272 = $<<240+300+272=812>>812\n#### 812",
