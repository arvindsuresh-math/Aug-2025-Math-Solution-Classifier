  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=49>>49 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 49 mph = $<<2*49=98>>98\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $98 + $50 = $<<98+50=148>>148\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $148 * 2 = $<<148*2=296>>296\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $296 = $<<240+300+296=836>>836",
