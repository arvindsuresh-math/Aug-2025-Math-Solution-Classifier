  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=44>>44 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 44 mph = $<<2*44=88>>88\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $88 + $50 = $<<88+50=138>>138\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $138 * 2 = $<<138*2=276>>276\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $276 = $<<240+300+276=816>>816",
