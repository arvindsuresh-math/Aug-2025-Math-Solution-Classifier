  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=45>>45 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 45 mph = $<<2*45=90>>90\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $90 + $50 = $<<90+50=170>>170\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $170 * 2 = $<<170*2=340>>340\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $340 = $<<240+300+340=880>>880\n#### 880",
