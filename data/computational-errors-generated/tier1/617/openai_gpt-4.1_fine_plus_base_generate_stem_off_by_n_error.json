  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=45>>45 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 45 mph = $<<2*45=90>>90\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $90 + $50 = $<<90+50=110>>110\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $110 * 2 = $<<110*2=220>>220\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $220 = $<<240+300+220=760>>760",
