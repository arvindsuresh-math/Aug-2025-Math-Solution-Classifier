  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=42>>42 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 42 mph = $<<2*42=84>>84\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $84 + $50 = $<<84+50=134>>134\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $134 * 2 = $<<134*2=268>>268\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $268 = $<<240+300+268=808>>808",
