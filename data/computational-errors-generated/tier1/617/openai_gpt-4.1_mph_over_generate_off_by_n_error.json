  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=50>>50 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 50 mph = $<<2*50=100>>100\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $100 + $50 = $<<100+50=150>>150\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $150 * 2 = $<<150*2=300>>300\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $300 = $<<240+300+300=840>>840",
