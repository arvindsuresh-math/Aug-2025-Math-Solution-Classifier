  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the two men each bought 30 apples, together they bought 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 apples.\nSince the two men each bought 30 apples, 20 less than the total number of apples bought by each woman, each woman bought 20+30 = <<20+30=30>>30 apples.\nThe total number of apples bought by the women is 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90\nAltogether, the two men and three women bought 60+90 = <<60+90=150>>150 apples.",
