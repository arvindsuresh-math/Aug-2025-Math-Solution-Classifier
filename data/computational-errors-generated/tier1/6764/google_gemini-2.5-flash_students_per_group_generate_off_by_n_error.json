  "flawed_nl_solution": "If each student travels with 5 others, then groups are made up of 5 + 1 = <<5+1=11>>11 students.\nThis means there are a total of 5 groups * 11 students = <<5*11=55>>55 students in the class.\nEach student needs 2 sandwiches, which means the teacher will make 55 students * 2 sandwiches per student= <<55*2=110>>110 sandwiches in total.\nTherefore, the teachers will need 110 sandwiches * 2 pieces of bread per sandwich= <<110*2=220>>220 pieces of bread.\n#### 220",
