  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jenna will drive 200 miles at a rate of 50 miles per hour, so she will drive for 4 hours.\nHer friend will drive 100 miles at a rate of 20 miles per hour, so Jenna's friend will drive for 5 hours.\nThey will spend a total of 60 minutes on breaks because 30 minutes + 30 minutes = <<30+30=60>>60 minutes.\nThus, they will spend 1 hour on breaks because there are 60 minutes in an hour.\nThe road trip will take a total of 1+4+5 = <<1+4+5=7>>7 hours.\n#### 7",
