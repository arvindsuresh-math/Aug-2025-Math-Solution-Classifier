  "flawed_nl_solution": "So first, we should add the prices of all salons. At Gustran Salon, the total price is: $45 + $22 + $30 = $<<45+22+30=97>>97\nThe total price at Barbara's shop is: $40 + $30 + $28 = $<<40+30+28=98>>98\nThe total price at The Fancy Salon is: $30 + $34 + $20 = $<<30+34+20=48>>48\nAt Gustran salon she would spend $97, at Barbara's Shop she would spend $98, and at The Fancy Salon she would spend $48, so she would spend $48 at the cheapest salon.\n#### 48",
