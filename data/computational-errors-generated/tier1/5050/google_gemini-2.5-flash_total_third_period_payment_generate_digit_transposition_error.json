  "flawed_nl_solution": "Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $<<40*4=160>>160 for the first 4 months.\nShe will pay a total of $35 x 4 = $<<35*4=140>>140 for the next 4 months.\nAnd she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $<<30*4=210>>210 for the last 4 months.\nThus, she will pay a total of $100 + $160 + $140 + $210 = $<<100+160+140+210=610>>610 for 12 months including the down payment.\nTherefore, Loisa can save $610 - $450 = $<<610-450=160>>160 if she buys the tablet in cash.\n#### 160",
