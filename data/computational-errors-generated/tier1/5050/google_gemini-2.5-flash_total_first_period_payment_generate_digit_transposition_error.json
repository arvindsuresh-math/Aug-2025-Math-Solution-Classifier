  "flawed_nl_solution": "Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $<<40*4=610>>610 for the first 4 months.\nShe will pay a total of $35 x 4 = $<<35*4=140>>140 for the next 4 months.\nAnd she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the last 4 months.\nThus, she will pay a total of $100 + $610 + $140 + $120 = $<<100+610+140+120=970>>970 for 12 months including the down payment.\nTherefore, Loisa can save $970 - $450 = $<<970-450=520>>520 if she buys the tablet in cash.\n#### 520",
