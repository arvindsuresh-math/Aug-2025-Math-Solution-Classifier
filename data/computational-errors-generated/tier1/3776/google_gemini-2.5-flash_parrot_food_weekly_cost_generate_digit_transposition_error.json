  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the rabbit food costs $12 a week, then the parrot food costs $30 - $12 = $81 a week.\nJulia has the parrot for 3 weeks, so she spent 3 weeks * $81/week = $<<3*81=243>>243 on her.\nThe rabbit is her only for 5 weeks, so she spent 5 weeks * $12/week = $<<5*12=60>>60 on him.\nIn total, Julia spent $243 + $60 = $<<243+60=303>>303 on food for her animals.\n#### 303",
