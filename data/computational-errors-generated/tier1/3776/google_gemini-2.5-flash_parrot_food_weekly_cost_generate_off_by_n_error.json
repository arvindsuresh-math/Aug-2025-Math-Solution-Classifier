  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the rabbit food costs $12 a week, then the parrot food costs $30 - $12 = $21 a week.\nJulia has the parrot for 3 weeks, so she spent 3 weeks * $21/week = $<<3*21=63>>63 on her.\nThe rabbit is her only for 5 weeks, so she spent 5 weeks * $12/week = $<<5*12=60>>60 on him.\nIn total, Julia spent $63 + $60 = $<<63+60=123>>123 on food for her animals.\n#### 123",
