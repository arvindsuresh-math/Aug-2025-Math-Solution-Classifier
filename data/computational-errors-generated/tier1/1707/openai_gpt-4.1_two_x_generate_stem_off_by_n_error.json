  "flawed_nl_solution": "Let's say Kamari has x toys. Anais has x + 30 toys.\nCombined, Anais and Kamari have a total of x + x + 30 =160 toys\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 30 =160\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 160 - 30 = <<160-30=100>>\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>, so the total number of toys that Kamari has is 50",
