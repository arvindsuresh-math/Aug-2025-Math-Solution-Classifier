  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first fisherman will catch 3*213 = <<3*213=639>>639 fish during the season.\nThe second fisherman catch 1*30 + 2*60 = <<1*30+2*60=151>>151 fish during the first 90 days of the season.\nThen, during the remaining 213 - 90 = 123 days of the season, the second fisherman will can an additional 4*123 = <<4*123=492>>492 fish.\nThus, the second fisherman will catch a total of 151 + 492 = <<151+492=643>>643 fish.\nTherefore, the second fisherman will catch 643 - 639 = <<643-639=4>>4 more fish than the first fisherman at the end of the season.",
