  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Randy wants to get an average of 94, then the sum of the 5 quizzes should be 94 x 5 = <<94*5=470>>470.\nThe sum of Randy's score for the first four quizzes is 90 + 98 + 92 + 94 = <<90+98+92+94=347>>347.\nThus, Randy needs to get 470 - 347 = <<470-347=123>>123 in his fifth quiz.",
