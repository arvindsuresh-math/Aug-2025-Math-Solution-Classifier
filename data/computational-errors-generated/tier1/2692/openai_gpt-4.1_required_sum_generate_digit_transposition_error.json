  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Randy wants to get an average of 94, then the sum of the 5 quizzes should be 94 x 5 = <<94*5=740>>740.\nThe sum of Randy's score for the first four quizzes is 90 + 98 + 92 + 94 = <<90+98+92+94=374>>374.\nThus, Randy needs to get 740 - 374 = <<740-374=366>>366 in his fifth quiz.\n#### 366",
