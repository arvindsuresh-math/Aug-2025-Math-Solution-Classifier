  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of scoops of ice cream that Mary has is 3 cartons * 10 scoops = <<3*10=30>>30 scoops of ice cream.\nLucas, Danny and Connor will eat 2 scoops * 3 people = <<2*3=6>>6 scoops of ice cream.\nShannon will eat 2 * (1 vanilla + 1 strawberry) = <<2*(1+1)=4>>4 total scoops of ice cream.\nCombined the kids will eat a total of 1 + 6 + 1 + 4 scoops = <<1+6+1+4=7>>7 scoops of ice cream.\nMary will have 30 scoops - 7 scoops = <<30-7=23>>23 scoops of ice cream remaining.",
