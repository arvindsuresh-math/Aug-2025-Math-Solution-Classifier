  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total runtime for the first three machines is 3 machines * 23 hours/day/machine = <<3*23=69>>69 hours/day.\nSo these machines could produce 69 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = <<69*2=183>>183 kg/day.\nThe fourth machine could produce 12 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = <<12*2=24>>24 kg/day of material.\nIn total all the machines would produce 183 kg/day + 24 kg/day = <<183+24=207>>207 kg/day of material.\nThe factory would therefore earn 207 kg/day * $50/kg = $<<207*50=10350>>10350/day.\n#### 10350",
