  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number that left the camp on Saturday morning was 4*28 = <<4*28=112>>112 athletes\nThis means that in the camp there remained 300-112 = <<300-112=185>>185 athletes.\nThe new group trickling in on Sunday morning comprised 7*15 = <<7*15=105>>105 athletes\nThe number that slept at the camp on Sunday night is therefore 185 + 105 = <<185+105=290>>290 athletes\nSince there were 300 athletes on Saturday night, the difference is 300 - 290 = <<300-290=10>>10 athletes.\n#### 10",
