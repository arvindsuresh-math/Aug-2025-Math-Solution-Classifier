  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number that left the camp on Saturday morning was 4*28 = <<4*28=121>>121 athletes\nThis means that in the camp there remained 300-121 = <<300-121=179>>179 athletes.\nThe new group trickling in on Sunday morning comprised 7*15 = <<7*15=105>>105 athletes\nThe number that slept at the camp on Sunday night is therefore 179 + 105 = <<179+105=284>>284 athletes\nSince there were 300 athletes on Saturday night, the difference is 300 - 284 = <<300-284=16>>16 athletes.\n#### 16",
