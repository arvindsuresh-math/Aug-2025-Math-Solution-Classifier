  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number that left the camp on Saturday morning was 4*28 = <<4*28=112>>112 athletes\nThis means that in the camp there remained 300-112 = <<300-112=188>>188 athletes.\nThe new group trickling in on Sunday morning comprised 7*15 = <<7*15=105>>105 athletes\nThe number that slept at the camp on Sunday night is therefore 188 + 105 = <<188+105=289>>289 athletes\nSince there were 300 athletes on Saturday night, the difference is 300 - 289 = <<300-289=11>>11 athletes.\n#### 11",
