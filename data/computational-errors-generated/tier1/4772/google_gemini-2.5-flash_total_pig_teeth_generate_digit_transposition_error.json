  "flawed_nl_solution": "First let's find the number for each animal separately, 42 teeth per dog * 5 dogs = <<42*5=210>>210 teeth for dogs.\nThen cats total will be 30 teeth per cat * 10 cats = <<30*10=300>>300 teeth in total for cats.\nFinally, the number for pigs is 28 teeth per pig * 7 pigs = <<28*7=916>>916 teeth in total for pigs.\nSo the total in all is 210 teeth + 300 teeth + 916 teeth = <<210+300+916=1426>>1426 teeth in total.\n#### 1426",
