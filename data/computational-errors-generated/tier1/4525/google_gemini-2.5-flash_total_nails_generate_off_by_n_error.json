  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, find the number of dog nails by multiplying the number of dogs by the number of nails on each leg and the number of legs on each dog: 4 dogs * 4 legs per dog * 4 nails per leg = <<4*4*4=64>>64 nails.\nThen do the same for parrots, ignoring the one parrot's extra toe for now: 8 parrots * 2 legs per parrot * 3 nails per leg = <<8*2*3=48>>48 nails\nNow add one to the previous number because one parrot has an extra toe: 48 + 1 = <<48+1=49>>49 nails.\nNow add the number of nails from the parrots and the dog: 49 nails + 64 nails = <<49+64=111>>111 nails.\n#### 111",
