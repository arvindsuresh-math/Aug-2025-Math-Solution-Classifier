  "flawed_nl_solution": "The daily average sales of pastries amounts to 20 pastries * $2/pastry = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nThe daily average sales of bread amounts to 10 loaves of bread * $4/loaf = $<<10*4=40>>40.\nTherefore, the daily average is $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80.\nToday's sales of pastries amounts to 14 pastries * $2/pastry = $<<14*2=28>>28.\nToday's sales of loaves of bread amounts to 25 loaves of bread * $4/loaf = $<<25*4=100>>100.\nTherefore, today's sales amount to $28 + $100 = $<<28+100=218>>218.\nThis means the total difference between today's sales and the daily average is $218 - $80 = $<<218-80=138>>138.\n#### 138",
