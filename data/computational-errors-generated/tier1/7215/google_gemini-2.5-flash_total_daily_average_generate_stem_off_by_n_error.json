  "flawed_nl_solution": "The daily average sales of pastries amounts to 20 pastries * $2/pastry = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nThe daily average sales of bread amounts to 10 loaves of bread * $4/loaf = $<<10*4=40>>40.\nTherefore, the daily average is $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=90>>90.\nToday's sales of pastries amounts to 14 pastries * $2/pastry = $<<14*2=28>>28.\nToday's sales of loaves of bread amounts to 25 loaves of bread * $4/loaf = $<<25*4=100>>100.\nTherefore, today's sales amount to $28 + $100 = $<<28+100=128>>128.\nThis means the total difference between today's sales and the daily average is $128 - $90 = $<<128-90=38>>38.\n#### 38",
