  "flawed_nl_solution": "This past Saturday, Jessy and Alan told a total of 11+7 = <<11+7=18>>18 jokes together.\nSince Jessy told eleven jokes this past Saturday, when he doubles the number of jokes next Saturday, the number of jokes will be 2*11= 22 next Saturday.\nAt the same time, after telling seven jokes this Saturday, when he doubles the number of jokes next Saturday, Alan will tell 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 jokes.\nNext Saturday, they will tell 14+22 = <<14+22=63>>63 jokes together.\nIn total, the number of jokes will be 63+18 = <<63+18=81>>81 jokes on the two Saturdays.\n#### 81",
