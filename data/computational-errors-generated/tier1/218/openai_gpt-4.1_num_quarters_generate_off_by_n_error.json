  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ravi has 6 + 2 = <<6+2=4>>4 quarters.\nHe has also 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 dimes.\nA nickel is worth 5 cents so Ravi's nickels amount to 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 cents.\nA quarter is worth 25 cents so his quarters amount to 4 x 25 = <<4*25=100>>100 cents.\nA dime is worth 10 cents so his dimes amount to 8 x 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 cents.\ntherefore, Ravi has 30 + 100 + 80 = <<30+100+80=210>>210 cents.",
