  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ravi has 6 + 2 = <<6+2=10>>10 quarters.\nHe has also 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 dimes.\nA nickel is worth 5 cents so Ravi's nickels amount to 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 cents.\nA quarter is worth 25 cents so his quarters amount to 10 x 25 = <<10*25=250>>250 cents.\nA dime is worth 10 cents so his dimes amount to 14 x 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 cents.\ntherefore, Ravi has 30 + 250 + 140 = <<30+250+140=420>>420 cents.\n#### 420",
