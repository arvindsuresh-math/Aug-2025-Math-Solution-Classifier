  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ravi has 6 + 2 = <<6+2=3>>3 quarters.\nHe has also 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 dimes.\nA nickel is worth 5 cents so Ravi's nickels amount to 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 cents.\nA quarter is worth 25 cents so his quarters amount to 3 x 25 = <<3*25=75>>75 cents.\nA dime is worth 10 cents so his dimes amount to 7 x 10 = <<7*10=70>>70 cents.\ntherefore, Ravi has 30 + 75 + 70 = <<30+75+70=175>>175 cents.",
