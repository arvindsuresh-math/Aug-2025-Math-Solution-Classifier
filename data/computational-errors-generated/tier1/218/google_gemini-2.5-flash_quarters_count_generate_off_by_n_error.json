  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ravi has 6 + 2 = <<6+2=6>>6 quarters.\nHe has also 6 + 4 = <<6+4=10>>10 dimes.\nA nickel is worth 5 cents so Ravi's nickels amount to 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 cents.\nA quarter is worth 25 cents so his quarters amount to 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 cents.\nA dime is worth 10 cents so his dimes amount to 10 x 10 = <<10*10=100>>100 cents.\ntherefore, Ravi has 30 + 150 + 100 = <<30+150+100=280>>280 cents.\n#### 280",
