  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Irene worked 50 hours last week, the total number of hours counting as overtime is 50-40 = <<50-40=30>>30 hours.\nSince she's given $20 for every hour of overtime, she earned 30*$20 = $<<30*20=600>>600 in overtime.\nHer total income, including the overtime, is $500 + $600= $<<500+600=1100>>1100\n#### 1100",
