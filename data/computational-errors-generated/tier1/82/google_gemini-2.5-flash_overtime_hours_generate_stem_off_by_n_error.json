  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Irene worked 50 hours last week, the total number of hours counting as overtime is 50-40 = <<50-40=40>>40 hours.\nSince she's given $20 for every hour of overtime, she earned 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800 in overtime.\nHer total income, including the overtime, is $500+$800= $<<500+800=1300>>1300\n#### 1300",
