  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the total production of mangoes was 400, then orange production was 400+200 = <<400+200=600>>600 kg of oranges.\nSince apple production was twice the total production of mangoes, Mr. Sergio had 2*400 = <<2*400=8000>>8000 kg of apples.\nThe total quantity of fruits produced at Mr. Sergio's farm is 8000 kg of apples+600 kg of oranges + 400 kg of mangoes = <<8000+600+400=9000>>9000 kg of fruits.\nIf Mr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg, his total income from the sales is 9000*$50 = $<<9000*50=450000>>450000.\n#### 450000",
