  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total distance Carson walks along the warehouse's long sides: 600 feet/side * 2 sides = <<600*2=1200>>1200 feet\nThen find the total distance Carson walks along the warehouse's short sides: 400 feet/side * 2 sides = <<400*2=800>>800 feet\nAdd those two amounts to find the total distance walk in one circle: 1200 feet + 800 feet = <<1200+800=2000>>2000 feet\nThen find the number of circles Carson actually walks: 10 circles - 2 circles = <<10-2=5>>5 circles\nThen multiply the distance of one circle by the number of circles Carson makes: 2000 feet/circle * 5 circles = <<2000*5=10000>>10000 feet\n#### 10000",
