  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of hours each worker works in the first 2 days is 10+8 = <<10+8=17>>17 hours.\nSince they completed the job in three days, each was compensated for 17+15 = <<17+15=32>>32 hours of work.\nMr Fletcher paid each of the workers $10 per hour of work, meaning for 32 hours, each of the workers received 32*$10 = $<<10*32=320>>320\nSince they were 2 workers, the total amount they received all together after each was paid $320 is $320*2 = $<<320*2=640>>640\n#### 640",
