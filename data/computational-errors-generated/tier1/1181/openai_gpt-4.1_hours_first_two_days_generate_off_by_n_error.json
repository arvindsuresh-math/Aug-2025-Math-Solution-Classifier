  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of hours each worker works in the first 2 days is 10+8 = <<10+8=20>>20 hours.\nSince they completed the job in three days, each was compensated for 20+15 = <<20+15=35>>35 hours of work.\nMr Fletcher paid each of the workers $10 per hour of work, meaning for 35 hours, each of the workers received 35*$10 = $<<10*35=350>>350\nSince they were two workers, the total amount they received all together after each was paid $350 is $350*2 = $<<350*2=700>>700\n#### 700",
