  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of hours each worker works in the first 2 days is 10+8 = <<10+8=18>>18 hours.\nSince they completed the job in three days, each was compensated for 18+15 = <<18+15=38>>38 hours of work.\nMr Fletcher paid each of the workers $10 per hour of work, meaning for 38 hours, each of the workers received 38*$10 = $<<10*38=380>>380\nSince they were 2 workers, the total amount they received all together after each was paid $380 is $380*2 = $<<380*2=760>>760\n#### 760",
