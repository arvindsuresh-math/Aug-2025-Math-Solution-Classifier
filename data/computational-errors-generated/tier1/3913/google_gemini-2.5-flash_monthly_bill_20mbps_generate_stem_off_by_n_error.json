  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total monthly bill for 30 Mbps is $20 x 2= $<<20*2=40>>40.\nShe will have to pay $40 x 12 = $<<40*12=480>>480 every year for 30mbps.\nThe total monthly bill for 20 Mbps is $20 + $10= $<<20+10=20>>20.\nSo, she will have to pay $20 x 12 = $<<20*12=240>>240 for 20 Mbps per year.\nTherefore the amount she will save per year if she chooses the 20mbps is $480 - $240 = $<<480-240=240>>240\n#### 240",
