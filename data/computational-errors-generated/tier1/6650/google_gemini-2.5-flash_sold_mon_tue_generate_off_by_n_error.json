  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday is 2445 + 900 = <<2445+900=3340>>3340 bottles\nEach day of the rest of the week, 50 bottles were sold, that is 5 * 50 = <<50*5=250>>250 bottles sold.\nNow the total of bottles sold in a week is 3340 + 250= <<3340+250=3590>>3590 bottles\nThe drugstore has in stock 4500 - 3590= <<4500-3590=910>>910 bottles\nFinally the drugstore has 910 + 650 the supplier brought = <<910+650=1560>>1560 bottles at the end of the week.\n#### 1560",
