  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday is 2445 + 900 = <<2445+900=3347>>3347 bottles\nEach day of the rest of the week, 50 bottles were sold, that is 5 * 50 = <<50*5=250>>250 bottles sold.\nNow the total of bottles sold in a week is 3347 + 250= <<3347+250=3597>>3597 bottles\nThe drugstore has in stock 4500 - 3597= <<4500-3597=903>>903 bottles\nFinally the drugstore has 903 + 650 the supplier brought = <<903+650=1553>>1553 bottles at the end of the week.\n#### 1553",
