  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday is 2445 + 900 = <<2445+900=3345>>3345 bottles\nEach day of the rest of the week, 50 bottles were sold, that is 5 * 50 = <<50*5=205>>205 bottles sold.\nNow the total of bottles sold in a week is 3345 + 205= <<3345+205=3550>>3550 bottles\nThe drugstore has in stock 4500 - 3550= <<4500-3550=950>>950 bottles\nFinally the drugstore has 950 + 650 the supplier brought = <<950+650=1600>>1600 bottles at the end of the week.\n#### 1600",
