  "flawed_nl_solution": "A red ticket is equal to 10 blue tickets, and a yellow is equal to ten red tickets, so a yellow ticket is also equal to 10 * 10 = <<10*10=100>>100 blue tickets.\nIt takes 10 yellow tickets to win a Bible, or 10 * 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1000 blue tickets.\nTom has 8 yellow tickets, which are worth 8 * 100 = <<8*100=800>>800 blue tickets.\nHe also has 3 red tickets, which are worth 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 blue tickets.\nAdded with his 7 blue tickets, he has 800 + 30 + 7 = <<800+30+7=835>>835 blue tickets' worth of tickets.\nSo he still needs to earn 1000 - 835 = <<1000-835=165>>165 blue tickets.",
