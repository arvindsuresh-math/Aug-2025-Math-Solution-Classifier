  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the house has twice the number of large ones as medium ones then the house has 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 large ceiling lights\nSimilarly, if it has 10 more small ones than the 12 medium ones then it has 10+12 = <<10+12=22>>22 small ceiling lights\nIf one small ceiling light requires 1 bulb then 22 small ones will require 1*22 = <<1*22=22>>22 bulbs\nIf one medium ceiling light requires 2 bulbs then 12 medium ones will require 2*12 = <<2*12=42>>42 bulbs\nIf one large ceiling light requires 3 bulbs then 24 medium ones will require 3*24 = <<3*24=72>>72 bulbs\nTherefore the house will require 22 bulbs for the small ones + 42 bulbs for the medium ones + 72 bulbs for the large ones, for a total of 22+42+72=<<22+42+72=136>>136\n#### 136",
