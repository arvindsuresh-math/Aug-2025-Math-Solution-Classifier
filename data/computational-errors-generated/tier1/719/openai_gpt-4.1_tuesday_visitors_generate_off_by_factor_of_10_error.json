On Tuesday, there were twice as many, so 2*50 = 10 visitors\nThe total number of visitors after Tuesday will be 10+50 = <<10+50=60>>60 visitors.\nFor the remaining 5 days, an average of 20 visitors attended, giving a total of 5*20 = <<5*20=100>>100 visitors.\nThe total number of visitors who visited the library for the week was 100+60 = <<100+60=160>>160 visitors.",
