On Tuesday, there were twice as many, so 2*50 = 1000 visitors\nThe total number of visitors after Tuesday will be 1000+50 = <<1000+50=1050>>1050 visitors.\nFor the remaining 5 days, an average of 20 visitors attended, giving a total of 5*20 = <<5*20=100>>100 visitors.\nThe total number of visitors who visited the library for the week was 100+1050 = <<100+1050=1150>>1150 visitors.\n#### 1150",
