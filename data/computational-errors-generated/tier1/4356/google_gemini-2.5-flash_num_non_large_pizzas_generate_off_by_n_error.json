  "flawed_nl_solution": "We know that 4 small pizzas and 5 medium pizzas = 4+5 = 5 non-large pizzas were purchased\nBecause a total of 15 pizzas were purchased then 15 - 5 = <<15-5=10>>10 large pizzas were ordered\nIf 1 small pizza has 6 slices then 4 small pizzas will have 4 * 6 = <<4*6=24>>24 slices\nSimilarly, If 1 medium pizza has 8 slices then 5 medium pizzas will have 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 slices\nSimilarly, If 1 large pizza has 12 slices then 10 large pizzas will have 10 * 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 slices\nThat means in total we have 24 small slices + 40 medium slices + 120 large slices = 24 + 40 + 120 = <<24+40+120=184>>184 slices of pizza\n#### 184",
