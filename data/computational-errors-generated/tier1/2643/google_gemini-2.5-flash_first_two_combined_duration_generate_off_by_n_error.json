  "flawed_nl_solution": "Brian begins by watching a 4-minute video, and since the second video is twice as long that means the second video is 4*2= <<4*2=8>>8 minutes.\nThe first two videos combined therefore for a 4+8=<<4+8=11>>11 minute run time.\nSince the third video is twice as long as the first two videos put together, that means it is 11*2=<<11*2=22>>22 minutes in length.\nThe total length of time spent is therefore 22+11= <<22+11=33>>33 minutes",
