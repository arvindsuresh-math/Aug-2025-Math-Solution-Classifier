  "flawed_nl_solution": "Brian begins by watching a 4-minute video, and since the second video is twice as long that means the second video is 4*2= <<4*2=8>>8 minutes.\nThe first two videos combined therefore for a 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 minute run time.\nSince the third video is twice as long as the first two videos put together, that means it is 12*2=<<12*2=42>>42 minutes in length.\nThe total length of time spent is therefore 42+12= <<42+12=54>>54 minutes\n#### 54",
