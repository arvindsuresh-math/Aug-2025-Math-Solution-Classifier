  "flawed_nl_solution": "Brian begins by watching a 4-minute video, and since the second video is twice as long that means the second video is 4*2= <<4*2=8>>8 minutes.\nThe first two videos combined therefore for a 4+8=<<4+8=14>>14 minute run time.\nSince the third video is twice as long as the first two videos put together, that means it is 14*2=<<14*2=28>>28 minutes in length.\nThe total length of time spent is therefore 28+14= <<28+14=42>>42 minutes\n#### 42",
