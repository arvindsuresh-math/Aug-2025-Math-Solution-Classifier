  "flawed_nl_solution": "Brian begins by watching a 4-minute video, and since the second video is twice as long that means the second video is 4*2= <<4*2=8>>8 minutes.\nThe first two videos combined therefore for a 4+8=<<4+8=10>>10 minute run time.\nSince the third video is twice as long as the first two videos put together, that means it is 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes in length.\nThe total length of time spent is therefore 20+10= <<20+10=30>>30 minutes",
