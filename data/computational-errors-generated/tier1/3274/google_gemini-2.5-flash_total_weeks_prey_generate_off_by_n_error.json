  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of weeks the Bobbit worm preys on the fish: 2 weeks + 1 week = <<2+1=2>>2 weeks\nThen multiply that number by the number of days per week: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days\nThen multiply that number by the number of fish the worm eats per day to find how many fish it eats total: 14 days * 2 fish/day = <<14*2=28>>28 fish\nThen add the number of fish James adds to the starting number of fish to find the ending number of fish: 60 fish + 8 fish = <<60+8=68>>68 fish\nThen subtract the number of eaten fish to find the number of surviving fish: 68 fish - 28 fish = <<68-28=40>>40 fish\n#### 40",
