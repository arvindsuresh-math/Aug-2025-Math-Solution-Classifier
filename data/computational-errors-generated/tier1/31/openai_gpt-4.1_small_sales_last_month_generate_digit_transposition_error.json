  "flawed_nl_solution": "Noah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=480>>480 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=210>>210 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $480 + $210 = $<<480+210=690>>690.\nSo, his sales this month are $690 x 2 = $<<690*2=1380>>1380.\n#### 1380",
