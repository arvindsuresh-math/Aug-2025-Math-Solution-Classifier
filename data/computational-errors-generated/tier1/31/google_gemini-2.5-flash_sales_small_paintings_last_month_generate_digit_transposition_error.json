  "flawed_nl_solution": "Noah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=480>>480 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=102>>102 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $480 + $102 = $<<480+102=582>>582.\nSo, his sales this month are $582 x 2 = $<<582*2=1164>>1164.\n#### 1164",
