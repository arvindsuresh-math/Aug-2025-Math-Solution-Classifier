  "flawed_nl_solution": "Noah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=480>>480 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $480 + $120 = $<<480+120=590>>590.\nSo, his sales this month are $590 x 2 = $<<590*2=1180>>1180.\n#### 1180",
