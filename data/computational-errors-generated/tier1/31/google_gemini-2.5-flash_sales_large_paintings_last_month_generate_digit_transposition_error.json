  "flawed_nl_solution": "Noah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=840>>840 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $840 + $120 = $<<840+120=960>>960.\nSo, his sales this month are $960 x 2 = $<<960*2=1920>>1920.\n#### 1920",
