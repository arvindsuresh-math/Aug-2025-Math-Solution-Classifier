  "flawed_nl_solution": "Noah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=408>>408 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $408 + $120 = $<<408+120=528>>528.\nSo, his sales this month are $528 x 2 = $<<528*2=1056>>1056.\n#### 1056",
