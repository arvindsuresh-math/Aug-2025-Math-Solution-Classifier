  "flawed_nl_solution": "On the eastern part of the campsite, Mr Manuel counted 2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 tents\nThe total number of tents in the eastern and the northern part of the campgrounds is 200+100 = <<200+100=320>>320\nThere are four times as many tents as the northernmost part in the central part of the campsite, which means there are 4*100 = <<4*100=400>>400 tents in the central part of the camp.\nThe total number of tents in the three parts of the campsite is 400+320 = <<400+320=720>>720\nIf you add the number of tents Mr. Manuel counted at the southern part of the campsite, you get 720+200 = <<720+200=920>>920 tents on the whole campsite\n#### 920",
