  "flawed_nl_solution": "After keeping 15 cards, Rick had 130 cards - 15 cards = 115 cards left.\nThe total number of cards given by Rick to his 8 friends was 8 friends x 12 cards/friend = <<8*12=96>>96 cards.\nThere were 2 sisters x 3 cards/sister = <<2*3=6>>6 cards given to Rick's sisters.\nSo, there were 96 cards + 6 cards = <<96+6=106>>106 cards left after Rick gave Miguel some cards.\nTherefore, 115 cards - 106 cards = <<115-106=9>>9 cards were given to Miguel.",
