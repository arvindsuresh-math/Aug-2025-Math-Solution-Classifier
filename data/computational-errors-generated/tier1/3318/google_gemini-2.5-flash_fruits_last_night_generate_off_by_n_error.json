  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of fruits that Kannon ate last is 3 apples+1 banana+4 oranges = <<3+1+4=3>>3\nSince last night Kannon had 3 apples, today she'll eat 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 apples.\nShe is also planning to eat 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, a total of 1*10 = <<10=10>>10 bananas.\nKannon will also eat twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she'll eat 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 oranges.\nTonight Kannon will eat 14 oranges+10 bananas +7 apples = <<14+10+7=31>>31 fruits\nIn total, after tonight, Kannon would have eaten 31+3 = <<31+3=34>>34 fruits.\n#### 34",
