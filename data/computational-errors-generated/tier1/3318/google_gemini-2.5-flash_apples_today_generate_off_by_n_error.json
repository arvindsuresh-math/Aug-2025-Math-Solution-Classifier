  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of fruits that Kannon ate last is 3 apples+1 banana+4 oranges = <<3+1+4=8>>8\nSince last night Kannon had 3 apples, today she'll eat 3+4 = <<3+4=8>>8 apples.\nShe is also planning to eat 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, a total of 1*10 = <<10=10>>10 bananas.\nKannon will also eat twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she'll eat 8*2 = <<8*2=16>>16 oranges.\nTonight Kannon will eat 16 oranges+10 bananas +8 apples = <<16+10+8=34>>34 fruits\nIn total, after tonight, Kannon would have eaten 34+8 = <<34+8=42>>42 fruits.\n#### 42",
