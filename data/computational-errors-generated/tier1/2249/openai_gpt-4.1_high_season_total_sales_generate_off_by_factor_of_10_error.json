If the sales are made for 15 hours, the total number of packs sold is 4=6*15 = <<6*15=90>>90 packs.\nAt $60 per pack, during a high season, the total sales in 15 hours are 90*$60 = $<<90*60=54000>>54000\n4 packs of tuna fish are sold per hour. If the sales are made for 15 hours, the total number of packs sold is 4*15 = <<4*15=60>>60 packs.\nAt $60 per pack, during a low season, the total sales in 15 hours are 60*$60 = $<<60*60=3600>>3600\nThe amount of money that is made after 15 hours during a high season than a low season is $54000-$3600 = $<<54000-3600=50400>>50400\n#### 50400",
