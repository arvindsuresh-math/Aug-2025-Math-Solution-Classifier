  "flawed_nl_solution": "The small panda bears eat a total of 4 x 25 = <<4*25=100>>100 pounds of bamboo every day.\nThe bigger panda bears eat a total of 5 x 40 = <<5*40=2000>>2000 pounds of bamboo every day.\nSo, the 9 pandas eat a total of 100 + 2000 = <<100+2000=2100>>2100 pounds of bamboo every day.\nTherefore, they eat a total of 2100 x 7 = <<2100*7=14700>>14700 pounds in a week.\n#### 14700",
