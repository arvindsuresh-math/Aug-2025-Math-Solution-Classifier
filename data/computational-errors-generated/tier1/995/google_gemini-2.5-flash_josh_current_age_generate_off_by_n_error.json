  "flawed_nl_solution": "We know that Josh must be 30 years older than his age when they got married, therefore he is 30 + 22 = <<30+22=48>>48 years old today\nIf their current combined age is 5 times the age Josh was when they married (22), then their total combined age is 5 * 22 = <<5*22=110>>110 years\nThat means that Anna must be 110 - 48 = <<110-48=62>>62 years old today\nIf they married 30 years ago, Anna must have been 62 - 30 = <<62-30=32>>32 years old when they married",
