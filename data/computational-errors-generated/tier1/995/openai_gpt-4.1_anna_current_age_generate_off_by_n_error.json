  "flawed_nl_solution": "We know that Josh must be 30 years older than his age when they got married, therefore he is 30 + 22 = <<30+22=52>>52 years old today\nIf their current combined age is 5 times the age Josh was when they married (22), then their total combined age is 5 * 22 = <<5*22=110>>110 years\nThat means that Anna must be 110 - 52 = <<110-52=53>>53 years old today\nIf they married 30 years ago, Anna must have been 53 - 30 = <<53-30=23>>23 years old when they married",
