  "flawed_nl_solution": "We know that Josh must be 30 years older than his age when they got married, therefore he is 30 + 22 = <<30+22=51>>51 years old today\nIf their current combined age is 5 times the age Josh was when they married (22), then their total combined age is 5 * 22 = <<5*22=110>>110 years\nThat means that Anna must be 110 - 51 = <<110-51=59>>59 years old today\nIf they married 30 years ago, Anna must have been 59 - 30 = <<59-30=29>>29 years old when they married\n#### 29",
