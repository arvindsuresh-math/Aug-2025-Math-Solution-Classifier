  "flawed_nl_solution": "Molly has 2 parents and 3 brothers, which totals 2+3=<<2+3=5>>5 parents and siblings.\nSince each brother is married with 2 children, then each brother has a family containing 1+2=<<1+2=4>>4 people.\nThus, the families of the three brothers contain an additional 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 relatives.\nIn total, Molly has 5+12=<<5+12=17>>17 relatives.\nAt $5 per package, Molly will spend 17*$5=$<<17*5=85>>85 to mail the packages.\n#### 85",
