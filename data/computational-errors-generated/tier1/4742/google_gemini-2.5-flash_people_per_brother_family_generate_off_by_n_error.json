  "flawed_nl_solution": "Molly has 2 parents and 3 brothers, which totals 2+3=<<2+3=5>>5 parents and siblings.\nSince each brother is married with 2 children, then each brother has a family containing 1+2=<<1+2=6>>6 people.\nThus, the families of the three brothers contain an additional 3*6=<<3*6=18>>18 relatives.\nIn total, Molly has 5+18=<<5+18=23>>23 relatives.\nAt $5 per package, Molly will spend 23*$5=$<<23*5=115>>115 to mail the packages.\n#### 115",
