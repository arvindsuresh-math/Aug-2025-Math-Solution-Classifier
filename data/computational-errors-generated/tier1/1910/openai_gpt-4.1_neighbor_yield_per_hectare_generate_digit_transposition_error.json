  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each hectare of Johnson's neighbor can yield 80 x 2 = <<80*2=610>>610 corns every two months.\nSo, the neighbor's two-hectare cornfield can yield a total of 610 x 2 = <<610*2=1220>>1220 corns every two months.\nThey yield a total of 80 + 1220 = <<80+1220=1300>>1300 corns.\nTherefore, They can harvest 1300 x 3 = <<1300*3=3900>>3900 corns altogether.\n#### 3900",
