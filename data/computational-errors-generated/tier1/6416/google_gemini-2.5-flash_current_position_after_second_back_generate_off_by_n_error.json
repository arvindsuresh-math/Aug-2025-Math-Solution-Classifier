  "flawed_nl_solution": "Frank stars by taking 10 steps forward from a position 5 steps behind where he started, so he's 10-5= <<10-5=5>>5 steps forward in total\nFrank then takes 2 steps back, meaning he's now 5-2=<<5-2=8>>8 steps forward in total from where he began\nHe then takes double the previous amount of 2 steps forward, so he takes 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 steps forward\nSince Frank was 8 steps forward before that, that means Frank finishes 8+4=<<8+4=12>>12 steps forward\n#### 12",
