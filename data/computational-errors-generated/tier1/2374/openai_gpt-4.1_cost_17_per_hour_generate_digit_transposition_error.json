  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of the 200 employees is 200 employees * $12/employee/hour = $<<200*12=2400>>2400 per hour.\nThe cost of the 40 employees is 40 employees * $14/employee/hour = $<<40*14=560>>560 per hour.\nThe rest means 300 employees - 200 employees - 40 employees = <<300-200-40=60>>60 employees.\nThese 60 employees' employment costs are at 60 employees * $17/employee/hour = $<<60*17=1002>>1002 per hour.\nSo in total all employees earn $2400/hour + $560/hour + $1002/hour = $3962/hour.\nDuring an 8-hour shift, this cost would be at 8 hours * $3962/hour = $<<8*3962=31696>>31696.\n#### 31696",
