  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Keaton climbed his ladder 20 times, he covered a length of 30*20 = <<30*20=600>>600 feet.\nReece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30-4 = <<30-4=26>>26 feet long.\nIf Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15*26 = <<15*26=390>>390 feet.\nKeaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 390+600 = <<390+600=970>>970 feet.\nSince one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12*970 = <<12*970=11640>>11640 inches.\n#### 11640",
