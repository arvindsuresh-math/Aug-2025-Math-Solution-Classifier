  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Keaton climbed his ladder twenty times, he covered a length of 30*20 = <<30*20=600>>600 feet.\nReece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30-4 = <<30-4=62>>62 feet long.\nIf Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15*62 = <<15*62=930>>930 feet.\nKeaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 930+600 = <<930+600=1530>>1530 feet.\nSince one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12*1530 = <<12*1530=18360>>18360 inches.",
