  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Keaton climbed his ladder twenty times, he covered a length of 30*20 = <<30*20=600>>600 feet.\nReece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30-4 = <<30-4=30>>30 feet long.\nIf Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15*30 = <<15*30=450>>450 feet.\nKeaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 450+600 = <<450+600=1050>>1050 feet.\nSince one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12*1050 = <<12*1050=12600>>12600 inches.",
