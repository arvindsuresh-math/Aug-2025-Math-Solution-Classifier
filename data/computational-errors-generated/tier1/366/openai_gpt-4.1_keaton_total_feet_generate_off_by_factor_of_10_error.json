  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Keaton climbed his ladder twenty times, he covered a length of 30*20 = <<30*20=60>>60 feet.\nReece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30-4 = <<30-4=26>>26 feet long.\nIf Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15*26 = <<15*26=390>>390 feet.\nKeaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 390+60 = <<390+60=450>>450 feet.\nSince one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12*450 = <<12*450=5400>>5400 inches.",
