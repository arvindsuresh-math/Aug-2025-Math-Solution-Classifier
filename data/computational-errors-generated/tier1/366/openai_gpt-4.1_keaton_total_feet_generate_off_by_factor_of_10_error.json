  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Keaton climbed his ladder twenty times, he covered a length of 30*20 = <<30*20=6000>>6000 feet.\nReece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30-4 = <<30-4=26>>26 feet long.\nIf Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15*26 = <<15*26=390>>390 feet.\nKeaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 390+6000 = <<390+6000=6390>>6390 feet.\nSince one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12*6390 = <<12*6390=76680>>76680 inches.",
