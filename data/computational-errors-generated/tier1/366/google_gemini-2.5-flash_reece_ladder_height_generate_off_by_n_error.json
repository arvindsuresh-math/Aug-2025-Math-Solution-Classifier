  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Keaton climbed his ladder 20 times, he covered a length of 30*20 = <<30*20=600>>600 feet.\nReece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30-4 = <<30-4=31>>31 feet long.\nIf Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15*31 = <<15*31=465>>465 feet.\nKeaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 465+600 = <<465+600=1065>>1065 feet.\nSince one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12*1065 = <<12*1065=12780>>12780 inches.\n#### 12780",
