  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Keaton climbed his ladder 20 times, he covered a length of 30*20 = <<30*20=600>>600 feet.\nReece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30-4 = <<30-4=22>>22 feet long.\nIf Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15*22 = <<15*22=330>>330 feet.\nKeaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 330+600 = <<330+600=930>>930 feet.\nSince one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12*930 = <<12*930=11160>>11160 inches.\n#### 11160",
