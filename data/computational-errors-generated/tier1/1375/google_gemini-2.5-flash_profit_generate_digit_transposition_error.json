  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 3 pigs that are sold after 12 months will cost the farmer 12*10*3 = $<<12*10*3=360>>360 in food costs.\nThe 3 pigs that are sold after 16 months will cost the farmer 16*10*3 = $<<16*10*3=480>>480 in food costs.\nThus, the total food cost to raise the 6 piglets was 360 + 480 = $<<360+480=840>>840.\nNext, selling the 6 fully grown pigs will earn the farmer 6*300 = $<<6*300=1800>>1800 in revenue.\nTherefore, the earn the farmer 1800 - 840 = $<<1800-840=906>>906 in profit from these sales.\n#### 906",
