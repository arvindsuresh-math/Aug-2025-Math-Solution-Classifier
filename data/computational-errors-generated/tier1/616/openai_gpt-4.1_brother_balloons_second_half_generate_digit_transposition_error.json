  "flawed_nl_solution": "Throughout the 30 minutes, Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute * 30 minutes = <<2*30=60>>60 balloons.\nHer brother works at double Kris' speed in the first 15 minutes so he works at 2 balloons per minute * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 balloons per minute.\nSo in the first 15 minutes, he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = <<4*15=60>>60 balloons.\nIn the second 15 minutes, he is working at double the rate he did previously, so he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 balloons per minute.\nIn the second 15 minutes, Kris\u2019 brother therefore blows up 8 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = <<8*15=210>>210 balloons.\nThroughout the 30 minutes, he has blown up a total of 60 + 210 = <<60+210=270>>270 balloons.\nKris and her brother therefore blew up a total of 60 balloons from Kris + 270 balloons from Kris\u2019 brother = <<60+270=330>>330 balloons.",
