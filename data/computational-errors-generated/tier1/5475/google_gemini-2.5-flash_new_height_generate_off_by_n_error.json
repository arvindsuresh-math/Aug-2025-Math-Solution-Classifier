  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find Devin's new height by adding his growth to the original height: 65 inches + 3 inches = <<65+3=73>>73 inches\nThen subtract 66 inches from Devin's height to find how many extra inches of height he has: 73 inches - 66 inches = <<73-66=7>>7 inches\nThen multiply the number of extra inches by the percentage increase per inch to find the total percentage increase in his chances: 7 inches * 10%/inch = 70%\nThen add the percentage increase to the base percentage to find Devin's overall chance of making the basketball team: 10% + 70% = 80%\n#### 80",
