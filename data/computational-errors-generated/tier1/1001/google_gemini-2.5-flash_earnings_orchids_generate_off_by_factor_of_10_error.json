  "flawed_nl_solution": "The plant supplier earned $50 x 20 = $<<50*20=100>>100 for the orchids.\nHe earned $25 x 15 = $<<25*15=375>>375 for the potted Chinese money plants.\nSo, his total earnings was $100 + $375 = $<<100+375=475>>475.\nThen he paid $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 to his workers.\nHe used a total of $80 + $150 = $<<80+150=230>>230 for the worker's pay and new pots.\nHence, he was left with $475 - $230 = $<<475-230=245>>245 from his earnings.\n#### 245",
