  "flawed_nl_solution": "The plant supplier earned $50 x 20 = $<<50*20=1000>>1000 for the orchids.\nHe earned $25 x 15 = $<<25*15=375>>375 for the potted Chinese money plants.\nSo, his total earnings was $1000 + $375 = $<<1000+375=1377>>1377.\nThen he paid $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 to his workers.\nHe used a total of $80 + $150 = $<<80+150=230>>230 for the worker's pay and new pots.\nHence, he was left with $1377 - $230 = $<<1147=1147>>1147 from his earnings.\n#### 1147",
