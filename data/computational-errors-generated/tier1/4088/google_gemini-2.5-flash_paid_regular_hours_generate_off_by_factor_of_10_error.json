  "flawed_nl_solution": "Bill makes $20 an hour for the first 40 hours, meaning he gets paid 40*20= <<40*20=8000>>8000 dollars.\nFor the remaining 10 hours, Bill gets paid double the amount of $20, meaning he makes 20*2=40 dollars an hour.\nSince he worked 10 hours at that $40 an hour rate, that means he gets paid 10*40= <<10*40=400>>400 dollars for the final 10 hours.\nIn total, this means Bill gets paid 8000+400=<<8000+400=8400>>8400 dollars for his workweek.\n#### 8400",
