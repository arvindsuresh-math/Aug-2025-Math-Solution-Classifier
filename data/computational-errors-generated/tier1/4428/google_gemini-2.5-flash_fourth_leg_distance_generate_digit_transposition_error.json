  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the third leg of Rick's trip was half the distance of the first leg, was 40 miles, this means the first leg was 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 miles long\nIf the second leg of the trip was twice the distance of the first leg, that means it was 80*2=<<80*2=160>>160 miles long\nIf the fourth leg was equal in distance to the total amount traveled across the first 3 legs, that means it was equal to 40+80+160= <<820=820>>820 miles long\nThis means in total Rick traveled 820+820= <<820+820=1640>>1640 miles\n#### 1640",
