  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=104>>104 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 104 x 2 = $<<104*2=208>>208.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=281>>281.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 208 + 281 = $<<208+281=489>>489.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 489 = $<<500-489=11>>11.\n#### 11",
