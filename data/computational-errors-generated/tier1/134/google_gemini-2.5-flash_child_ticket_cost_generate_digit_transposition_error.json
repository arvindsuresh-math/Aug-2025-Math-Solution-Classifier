  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=140>>140 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 140 x 2 = $<<140*2=280>>280.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 280 + 218 = $<<280+218=498>>498.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 498 = $<<500-498=2>>2.\n#### 2",
