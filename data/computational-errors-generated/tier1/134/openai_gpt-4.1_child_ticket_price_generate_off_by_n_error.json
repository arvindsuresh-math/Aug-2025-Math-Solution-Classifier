  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=101>>101 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 101 x 2 = $<<101*2=202>>202.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 202 + 218 = $<<202+218=420>>420.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 420 = $<<500-420=80>>80.",
