  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=109>>109 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 218 + 218 = $<<218+218=436>>436.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 436 = $<<500-436=64>>64.",
