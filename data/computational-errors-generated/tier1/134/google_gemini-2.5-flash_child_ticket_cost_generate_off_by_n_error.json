  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=103>>103 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 103 x 2 = $<<103*2=206>>206.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 206 + 218 = $<<206+218=424>>424.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 424 = $<<500-424=76>>76.\n#### 76",
