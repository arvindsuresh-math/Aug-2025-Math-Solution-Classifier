  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=105>>105 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 105 x 2 = $<<105*2=210>>210.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 210 + 218 = $<<210+218=428>>428.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 428 = $<<500-428=72>>72.\n#### 72",
