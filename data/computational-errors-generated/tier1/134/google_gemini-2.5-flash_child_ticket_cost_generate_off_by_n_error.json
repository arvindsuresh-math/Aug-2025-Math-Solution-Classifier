  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=99>>99 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 99 x 2 = $<<99*2=198>>198.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 198 + 218 = $<<198+218=416>>416.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 416 = $<<500-416=84>>84.",
