  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=100>>100 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 100 x 2 = $<<100*2=200>>200.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 200 + 218 = $<<200+218=418>>418.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 418 = $<<500-418=82>>82.\n#### 82",
