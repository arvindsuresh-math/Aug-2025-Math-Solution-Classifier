  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the road has four lanes and 60 trucks in each lane, the total number of trucks in all the lanes is 60*4 = <<4*60=240>>240.\nSince in each lane the number of cars is twice as many as the number of trucks in all the lanes, there are 2*240=480 cars in each lane.\nThe total number of cars in all the lanes is 480*4 = <<480*4=9120>>9120\nIn all the lanes, the total number of vehicles is 240 trucks+9120 cars = <<240+9120=9360>>9360\n#### 9360",
