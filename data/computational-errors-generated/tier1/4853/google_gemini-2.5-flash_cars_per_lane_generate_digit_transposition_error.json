  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the road has four lanes and 60 trucks in each lane, the total number of trucks in all the lanes is 60*4 = <<4*60=240>>240.\nSince in each lane the number of cars is twice as many as the number of trucks in all the lanes, there are 2*240=408 cars in each lane.\nThe total number of cars in all the lanes is 408*4 = <<408*4=1632>>1632\nIn all the lanes, the total number of vehicles is 240 trucks+1632 cars = <<240+1632=1872>>1872\n#### 1872",
