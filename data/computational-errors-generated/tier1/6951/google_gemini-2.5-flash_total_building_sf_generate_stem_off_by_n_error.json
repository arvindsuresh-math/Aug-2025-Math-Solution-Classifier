  "flawed_nl_solution": "If 5000 square feet represents one-quarter of the second floor storage space, then the second floor has 5000*4=<<5000*4=20000>>20000 square feet of storage space.\nSince the first floor has twice as much space as the second floor, then the first floor has 20000*2=<<20000*2=40000>>40000 square feet of storage space.\nAltogether, when empty, the entire building has 20000+40000=<<20000+40000=60020>>60020 square feet of storage space.\nSince the second floor has 5000 square feet of storage space filled with boxes, then there are 60020-5000=55020 square feet of unused storage space still available in the building.\n#### 55020",
