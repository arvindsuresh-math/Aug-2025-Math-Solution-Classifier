  "flawed_nl_solution": "If 5000 square feet represents one-quarter of the second floor storage space, then the second floor has 5000*4=<<5000*4=200000>>200000 square feet of storage space.\nSince the first floor has twice as much space as the second floor, then the first floor has 200000*2=<<200000*2=400000>>400000 square feet of storage space.\nAltogether, when empty, the entire building has 200000+400000=<<200000+400000=600000>>600000 square feet of storage space.\nSince the second floor has 5000 square feet of storage space filled with boxes, then there are 600000-5000=595000 square feet of unused storage space still available in the building.\n#### 595000",
