  "flawed_nl_solution": "The booth made $50 x 3 = $<<50*3=150>>150 selling cotton candy each day.\nIn a day, the booth made a total of $150 + $50 = $<<150+50=2000>>2000.\nIn 5 days, they made a total of $2000 x 5 = $<<2000*5=10000>>10000.\nThe booth has to pay a total of $30 + $75 = $<<30+75=105>>105.\nThus, the booth earned $10000 - $105 = $<<10000-105=9895>>9895.\n#### 9895",
