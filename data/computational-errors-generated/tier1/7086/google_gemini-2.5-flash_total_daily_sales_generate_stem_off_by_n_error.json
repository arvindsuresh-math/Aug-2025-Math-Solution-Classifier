  "flawed_nl_solution": "The booth made $50 x 3 = $<<50*3=150>>150 selling cotton candy each day.\nIn a day, the booth made a total of $150 + $50 = $<<150+50=220>>220.\nIn 5 days, they made a total of $220 x 5 = $<<220*5=1100>>1100.\nThe booth has to pay a total of $30 + $75 = $<<30+75=105>>105.\nThus, the booth earned $1100 - $105 = $<<1100-105=995>>995.\n#### 995",
