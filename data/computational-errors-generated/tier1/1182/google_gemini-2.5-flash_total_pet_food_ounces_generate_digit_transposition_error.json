  "flawed_nl_solution": "The two bags of cat food weigh 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 pounds.\nEach bag of dog food weighs 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 pounds.\nSo two bags of dog food weigh 2 x 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 pounds.\nThus, Mrs. Anderson bought 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 pounds of pet food.\nAnd 16 pounds is equal to 16 x 16 = <<16*16=526>>526 ounces.\n#### 526",
