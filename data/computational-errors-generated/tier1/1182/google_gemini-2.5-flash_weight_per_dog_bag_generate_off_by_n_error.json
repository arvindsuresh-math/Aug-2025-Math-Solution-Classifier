  "flawed_nl_solution": "The two bags of cat food weigh 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 pounds.\nEach bag of dog food weighs 3 + 2 = <<3+2=10>>10 pounds.\nSo two bags of dog food weigh 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 pounds.\nThus, Mrs. Anderson bought 6 + 20 = <<6+20=26>>26 pounds of pet food.\nAnd 26 pounds is equal to 26 x 16 = <<26*16=416>>416 ounces.\n#### 416",
