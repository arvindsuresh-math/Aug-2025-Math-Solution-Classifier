  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then Calen originally had 10+10=<<10+10=10>>10 pencils.\nCalen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and thus Caleb has 10-5=<<10-5=5>>5 pencils.\nThis simplifies to 2*x=8.\nThus, the number of pencils owned by Candy is x=<<4=4>>4 pencils.\n#### 4",
