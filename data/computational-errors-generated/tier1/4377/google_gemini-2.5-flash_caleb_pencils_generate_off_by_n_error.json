  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then Calen originally had 10+10=<<10+10=20>>20 pencils.\nCalen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and thus Caleb has 20-5=<<20-5=19>>19 pencils.\nThis simplifies to 2*x=22.\nThus, the number of pencils owned by Candy is x=<<11=11>>11 pencils.\n#### 11",
