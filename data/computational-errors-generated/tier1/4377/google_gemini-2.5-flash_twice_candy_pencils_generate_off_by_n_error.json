  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then Calen originally had 10+10=<<10+10=20>>20 pencils.\nCalen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and thus Caleb has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 pencils.\nThis simplifies to 2*x=16.\nThus, the number of pencils owned by Candy is x=<<8=8>>8 pencils.\n#### 8",
