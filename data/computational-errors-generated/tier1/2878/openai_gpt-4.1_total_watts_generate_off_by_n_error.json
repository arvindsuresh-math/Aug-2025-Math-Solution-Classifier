  "flawed_nl_solution": "Noah\u2019s bedroom light uses 6 watts per hour, so it would use 2 * 6 = <<6*2=12>>12 watts in two hours.\nHis office light uses 3 times as many watts as his bedroom light, so it uses 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 watts per hour.\nIn two hours, the office light would use 18 * 2 = <<18*2=36>>36 watts.\nThe living room light uses 4 times as many watts as his bedroom light, so it uses 4 * 6 = <<4*6=24>>24 watts per hour.\nIn two hours, the living room light would use 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 watts.\nThus, if Noah leaves all those lights on for two hours, he has used 12 + 36 + 48 = <<12+36+48=94>>94 watts.",
