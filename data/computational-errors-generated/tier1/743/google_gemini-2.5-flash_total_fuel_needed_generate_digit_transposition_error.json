  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of people by adding the number of passengers and flight crew: 30 people + 5 people = <<30+5=35>>35 people\nThen find the total number of bags by doubling the total number of people: 35 people * 2 bags/person = <<35*2=70>>70 bags\nThen find the fuel increase caused by the people by multiplying their number by the fuel increase per person: 35 people * 3 gallons/mile/person = <<35*3=105>>105 gallons/mile\nThen multiply the number of bags by the fuel increase per bag to find the total fuel increase they cause: 70 bags * 2 gallons/mile/bag = <<70*2=140>>140 gallons/mile\nNow add the fuel increases to the base fuel consumption to find the total fuel needed per mile: 140 gallons/mile + 105 gallons/mile + 20 gallons/mile = <<140+105+20=265>>265 gallons/mile\nNow multiply the fuel consumption per mile by the number of miles flown to find the total amount of fuel needed: 265 gallons/mile * 400 miles = <<265*400=100600>>100600 gallons of fuel",
