  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of people by adding the number of passengers and flight crew: 30 people + 5 people = <<30+5=37>>37 people\nThen find the total number of bags by doubling the total number of people: 37 people * 2 bags/person = <<37*2=74>>74 bags\nThen find the fuel increase caused by the people by multiplying their number by the fuel increase per person: 37 people * 3 gallons/mile/person = <<37*3=111>>111 gallons/mile\nThen multiply the number of bags by the fuel increase per bag to find the total fuel increase they cause: 74 bags * 2 gallons/mile/bag = <<74*2=148>>148 gallons/mile\nNow add the fuel increases to the base fuel consumption to find the total fuel needed per mile: 148 gallons/mile + 111 gallons/mile + 20 gallons/mile = <<148+111+20=279>>279 gallons/mile\nNow multiply the fuel consumption per mile by the number of miles flown to find the total amount of fuel needed: 279 gallons/mile * 400 miles = <<279*400=111600>>111600 gallons of fuel",
