  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of people by adding the number of passengers and flight crew: 30 people + 5 people = <<30+5=34>>34 people\nThen find the total number of bags by doubling the total number of people: 34 people * 2 bags/person = <<34*2=68>>68 bags\nThen find the fuel increase caused by the people by multiplying their number by the fuel increase per person: 34 people * 3 gallons/mile/person = <<34*3=102>>102 gallons/mile\nThen multiply the number of bags by the fuel increase per bag to find the total fuel increase they cause: 68 bags * 2 gallons/mile/bag = <<68*2=136>>136 gallons/mile\nNow add the fuel increases to the base fuel consumption to find the total fuel needed per mile: 136 gallons/mile + 102 gallons/mile + 20 gallons/mile = <<136+102+20=258>>258 gallons/mile\nNow multiply the fuel consumption per mile by the number of miles flown to find the total amount of fuel needed: 258 gallons/mile * 400 miles = <<258*400=103200>>103200 gallons of fuel",
