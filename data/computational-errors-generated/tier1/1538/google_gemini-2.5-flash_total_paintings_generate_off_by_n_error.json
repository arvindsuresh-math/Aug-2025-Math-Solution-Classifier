  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Marcus creates 2 paintings on the first day, then he can paint 2 paintings * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nSo he paints 4 paintings * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = <<2+4+8+16+32=64>>64 paintings.\n#### 64",
