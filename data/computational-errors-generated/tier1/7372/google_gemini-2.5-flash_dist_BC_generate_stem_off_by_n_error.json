  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the distance between city A and B is 100 miles, and city B and C are 50 more miles apart than city A and B, then city B and C are 100+50 = <<100+50=120>>120 miles apart.\nThe plane's total flying distance between cities A and C is 100+120= <<100+120=220>>220 miles.\nThe distance between city C and city D is twice the distance between city B and city C, meaning city C and city D are 2*120 = <<240=240>>240 miles apart.\nThe plane flies a distance of 220+240 = <<220+240=460>>460 miles from city A to city D.\n#### 460",
