  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the distance between city A and B is 100 miles, and city B and C are 50 more miles apart than city A and B, then city B and C are 100+50 = <<100+50=510>>510 miles apart.\nThe plane's total flying distance between cities A and C is 100+510= <<100+510=610>>610 miles.\nThe distance between city C and city D is twice the distance between city B and city C, meaning city C and city D are 2*510 = <<1020=1020>>1020 miles apart.\nThe plane flies a distance of 610+1020 = <<610+1020=1630>>1630 miles from city A to city D.\n#### 1630",
