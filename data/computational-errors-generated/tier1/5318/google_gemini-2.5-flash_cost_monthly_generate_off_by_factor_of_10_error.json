  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the number of weeks Casey stays: 3 months * 4 weeks/month = <<3*4=12>>12 weeks\nThen multiply that number by the weekly rate to find how much she would pay weekly: 12 weeks * $280/week = $<<12*280=3360>>3360\nThen multiply the number of months she stays by the monthly rate to find how much she pays monthly: $1000/month * 3 months = $<<1000*3=300>>300\nThen subtract that number from the total amount she pays if she pays weekly to find her savings: $3360 - $300 = $<<3360-300=3060>>3060\n#### 3060",
