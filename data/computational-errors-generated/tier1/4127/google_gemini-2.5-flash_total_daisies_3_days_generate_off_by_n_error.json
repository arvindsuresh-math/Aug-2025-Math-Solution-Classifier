  "flawed_nl_solution": "The flower shop sold 45 + 20 = <<45+20=65>>65 daisies on the second day.\nTwice the number of flowers on the second day is 65 x 2 = <<65*2=130>>130.\nSo, the flower shop sold 130 - 10 = <<130-10=120>>120 daisies on the third day.\nThe total daisies sold for 3 days was 45 + 65 + 120 = <<45+65+120=229>>229.\nTherefore, 350 - 229 = <<350-229=121>>121 daisies were sold on the 4th day.\n#### 121",
