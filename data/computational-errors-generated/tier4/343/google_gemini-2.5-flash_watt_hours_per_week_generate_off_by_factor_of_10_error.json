  "flawed_nl_solution": "She uses 4 hours/day * 125 watts/hour=<<4*125=500>>500 watt hours/day\nThat means she uses 500 watt hours/day * 7 days/week = <<500*7=35000>>35000 watt hours/week\nThis is 35000 watt hours / 1000 watts/kw = <<35000/1000=35>>35 kw hours\nSo her TV cost 35 kw hours/week * $0.14/kw hour = $<<35*0.14=4.9>>4.9/week\n#### 490.00000000000006",
