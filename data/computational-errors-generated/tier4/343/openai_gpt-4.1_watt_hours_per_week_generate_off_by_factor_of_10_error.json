  "flawed_nl_solution": "She uses 4 hours/day * 125 watts/hour=<<4*125=500>>500 watt hours/day\nThat means she uses 500 watt hours/day * 7 days/week = <<500*7=350>>350 watt hours/week\nThis is 350 watt hours / 1000 watts/kw = <<350/1000=0.35>>0.35 kw hours\nSo her TV cost 0.35 kw hours/week * $0.14/kw hour = $<<0.35*0.14=0.049>>0.049/week",
