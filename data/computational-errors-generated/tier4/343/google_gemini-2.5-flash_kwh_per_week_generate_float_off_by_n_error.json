  "flawed_nl_solution": "She uses 4 hours/day * 125 watts/hour=<<4*125=500>>500 watt hours/day\nThat means she uses 500 watt hours/day * 7 days/week = <<500*7=3500>>3500 watt hours/week\nThis is 3500 watt hours / 1000 watts/kw = <<3500/1000=3.86>>3.86 kw hours\nSo her TV cost 3.86 kw hours/week * $0.14/kw hour = $<<3.86*0.14=0.54>>0.54/week\n#### 54.06643997720001",
