  "flawed_nl_solution": "She uses 4 hours/day * 125 watts/hour=<<4*125=500>>500 watt hours/day\nThat means she uses 500 watt hours/day * 7 days/week = <<500*7=3050>>3050 watt hours/week\nThis is 3050 watt hours / 1000 watts/kw = <<3050/1000=3.05>>3.05 kw hours\nSo her TV cost 3.05 kw hours/week * $0.14/kw hour = $<<3.05*0.14=0.427>>0.427/week",
