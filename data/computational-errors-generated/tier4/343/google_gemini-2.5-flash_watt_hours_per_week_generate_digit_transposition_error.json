  "flawed_nl_solution": "She uses 4 hours/day * 125 watts/hour=<<4*125=500>>500 watt hours/day\nThat means she uses 500 watt hours/day * 7 days/week = <<500*7=5300>>5300 watt hours/week\nThis is 5300 watt hours / 1000 watts/kw = <<5300/1000=5.3>>5.3 kw hours\nSo her TV cost 5.3 kw hours/week * $0.14/kw hour = $<<5.3*0.14=0.74>>0.74/week\n#### 74.2",
