  "flawed_nl_solution": "A jar of almond butter costs 3 * 3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.\nIt takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies, so it costs 9 / 0.5 = $<<9/0.5=18>>18 to use almond butter.\nIt costs 3 / 0.5 = $<<3/0.5=6>>6 to use peanut butter.\nThus, it costs 18 - 6 = $<<18-6=14>>14 more to make a batch of almond butter cookies than peanut butter cookies.\n#### 14",
