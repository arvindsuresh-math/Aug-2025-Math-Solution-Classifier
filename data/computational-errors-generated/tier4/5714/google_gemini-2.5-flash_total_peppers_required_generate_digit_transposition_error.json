  "flawed_nl_solution": "If each sandwich comes with 4 strips of pepper, and each pepper makes 8 slices, then each sandwich uses 4/8=<<4/8=0.5>>0.5 pepper.\nIf the Sandwich Shop serves a sandwich every 5 minutes, then per hour the Shop serves 60/5=<<60/5=12>>12 sandwiches.\nThus, per hour, the Shop uses 12*0.5=<<12*0.5=6>>6 jalapeno peppers.\nAnd in an 8-hour day, the Sandwich Shop uses 8*6=<<8*6=84>>84 jalapeno peppers.\n#### 84",
