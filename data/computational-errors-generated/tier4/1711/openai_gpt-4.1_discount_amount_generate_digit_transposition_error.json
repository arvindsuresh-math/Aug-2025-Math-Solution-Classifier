  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 adult tickets\nSo 6*30=$<<6*30=180>>180 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=$<<30/2=15>>15 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15*4=$<<15*4=60>>60\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60+180=$<<60+180=240>>240\nThey get a 240*0.2=$<<240*0.2=84>>84 discount\nSo the tickets cost 240-84=$<<240-84=156>>156\nSo in total she paid 156+5=$<<156+5=161>>161\n#### 161",
