  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 adult tickets\nSo 6*30=$<<6*30=180>>180 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=$<<30/2=15.0>>15.0 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15.0*4=$<<15.0*4=60.0>>60.0\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60.0+180=$<<60.0+180=240.0>>240.0\nThey get a 240.0*0.2=$<<240.0*0.2=84.0>>84.0 discount\nSo the tickets cost 240.0-84.0=$<<240.0-84.0=156.0>>156.0\nSo in total she paid 156.0+5=$<<156.0+5=161.0>>161.0",
