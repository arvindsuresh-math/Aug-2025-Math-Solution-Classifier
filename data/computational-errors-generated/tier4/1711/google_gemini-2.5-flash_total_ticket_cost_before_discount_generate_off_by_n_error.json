  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 adult tickets\nSo 6*30=<<6*30=180>>$180 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=<<30/2=15.0>>$15.0 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15.0*4=<<15.0*4=60.0>>$60.0\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60.0+180=<<60.0+180=245.0>>$245.0\nThey get a 245.0*0.2=<<245.0*0.2=49.0>>$49.0 discount\nSo the tickets cost 245.0-49.0=<<245.0-49.0=196.0>>$196.0\nSo in total she paid 196.0+5=<<196.0+5=201.0>>$201.0",
