  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 adult tickets\nSo 6*30=<<6*30=810>>$810 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=<<30/2=15>>$15 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15*4=<<15*4=60>>$60\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60+810=<<60+810=870>>$870\nThey get a 870*0.2=<<870*0.2=174>>$174 discount\nSo the tickets cost 870-174=<<870-174=696>>$696\nSo in total she paid 696+5=<<696+5=701>>$701\n#### 701",
