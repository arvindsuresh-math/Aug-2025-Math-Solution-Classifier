  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=7>>7 adult tickets\nSo 7*30=<<7*30=210>>$210 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=<<30/2=15.0>>$15.0 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15.0*4=<<15.0*4=60.0>>$60.0\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60.0+210=<<60.0+210=270.0>>$270.0\nThey get a 270.0*0.2=<<270.0*0.2=54.0>>$54.0 discount\nSo the tickets cost 270.0-54.0=<<270.0-54.0=216.0>>$216.0\nSo in total she paid 216.0+5=<<216.0+5=221.0>>$221.0",
