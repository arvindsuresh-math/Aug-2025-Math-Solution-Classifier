  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=11>>11 adult tickets\nSo 11*30=<<11*30=330>>$330 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=<<30/2=15>>$15 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15*4=<<15*4=60>>$60\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60+330=<<60+330=390>>$390\nThey get a 390*0.2=<<390*0.2=78>>$78 discount\nSo the tickets cost 390-78=<<390-78=312>>$312\nSo in total she paid 312+5=<<312+5=317>>$317",
