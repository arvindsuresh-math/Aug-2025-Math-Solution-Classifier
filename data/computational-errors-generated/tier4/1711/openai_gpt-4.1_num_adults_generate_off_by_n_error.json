  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=9>>9 adult tickets\nSo 9*30=$<<9*30=270>>270 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=$<<30/2=15.0>>15.0 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15.0*4=$<<15.0*4=60.0>>60.0\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60.0+270=$<<60.0+270=330.0>>330.0\nThey get a 330.0*0.2=$<<330.0*0.2=66.0>>66.0 discount\nSo the tickets cost 330.0-66.0=$<<330.0-66.0=264.0>>264.0\nSo in total she paid 264.0+5=$<<264.0+5=269.0>>269.0",
