  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 adult tickets\nSo 6*30=<<6*30=180>>$180 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=<<30/2=15.0>>$15.0 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15.0*4=<<15.0*4=60.0>>$60.0\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60.0+180=<<60.0+180=420.0>>$420.0\nThey get a 420.0*0.2=<<420.0*0.2=84.0>>$84.0 discount\nSo the tickets cost 420.0-84.0=<<420.0-84.0=336.0>>$336.0\nSo in total she paid 336.0+5=<<336.0+5=341.0>>$341.0",
