  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 adult tickets\nSo 6*30=$<<6*30=180>>180 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=$<<30/2=15.0>>15.0 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15.0*4=$<<15.0*4=60.0>>60.0\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60.0+180=$<<60.0+180=235.0>>235.0\nThey get a 235.0*0.2=$<<235.0*0.2=47.0>>47.0 discount\nSo the tickets cost 235.0-47.0=$<<235.0-47.0=188.0>>188.0\nSo in total she paid 188.0+5=$<<188.0+5=193.0>>193.0",
