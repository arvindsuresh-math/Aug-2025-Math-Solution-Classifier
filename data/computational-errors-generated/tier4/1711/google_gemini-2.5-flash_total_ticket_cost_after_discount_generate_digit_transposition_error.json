  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 adult tickets\nSo 6*30=<<6*30=180>>$180 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=<<30/2=15.0>>$15.0 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15.0*4=<<15.0*4=60.0>>$60.0\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60.0+180=<<60.0+180=240.0>>$240.0\nThey get a 240.0*0.2=<<240.0*0.2=48.0>>$48.0 discount\nSo the tickets cost 240.0-48.0=<<240.0-48.0=129.0>>$129.0\nSo in total she paid 129.0+5=<<129.0+5=134.0>>$134.0",
