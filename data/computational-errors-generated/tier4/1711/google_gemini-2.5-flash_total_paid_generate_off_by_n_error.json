  "flawed_nl_solution": "She bought 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 adult tickets\nSo 6*30=<<6*30=180>>$180 was the cost for adult tickets\nChildren tickets cost 30/2=<<30/2=15>>$15 each\nSo the children tickets cost 15*4=<<15*4=60>>$60\nSo the total cost of tickets is 60+180=<<60+180=240>>$240\nThey get a 240*0.2=<<240*0.2=48>>$48 discount\nSo the tickets cost 240-48=<<240-48=192>>$192\nSo in total she paid 192+5=<<192+5=194>>$194",
