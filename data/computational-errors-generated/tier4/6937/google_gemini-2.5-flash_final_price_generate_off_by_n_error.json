  "flawed_nl_solution": "Two kilograms of sugar is priced at $1.5 x 2 = $<<2*1.5=3>>3.\nThree kilograms of sugar is priced at $1.5 x 3 = $<<3*1.5=4.5>>4.5.\nSo five kilograms of salt is priced at $5.5 - $3 = $2.5.\nThus, a kilogram of salt is priced at $2.5/5 = $<<2.5/5=0.5>>0.5.\nHence, three kilograms of sugar and a kilogram of salt.s price is $4.5 + $0.5 = $8.\n#### 8",
