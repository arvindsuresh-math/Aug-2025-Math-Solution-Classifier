  "flawed_nl_solution": "She needs 4 cups of strawberries per quart of ice cream and the strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages. So 4/2 = <<4/2=2.0>>2.0 packages of strawberries\nThe strawberries cost $3.0 per package and she needs 2.0 so 3.0*2.0=$<<3.0*2.0=6.0>>6.0\nShe needs 4 cups of raspberries per quart of ice cream and the raspberries are sold in 2 cup packages. So 4/2 = <<4/2=2.0>>2.0 packages of raspberries\nThe raspberries cost $5.0 per package and she needs 2.0 so 5.0*2.0 = $<<5.0*2.0=10.0>>10.0\nEvery quart needs 2 cups of heavy cream and she's making 2 quarts so 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 quarts\nShe will spend $6.0 on strawberries, $10.0 on raspberries and $4.0 on heavy cream bringing the total to 6.0+10.0+4.0 = $<<6.0+10.0+4.0=24.0>>24.0",
