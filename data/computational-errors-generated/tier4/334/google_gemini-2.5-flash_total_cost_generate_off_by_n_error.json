  "flawed_nl_solution": "She needs 4 cups of strawberries per quart of ice cream and the strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages. So 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 packages of strawberries\nThe strawberries cost $3 per package and she needs 2 so 3*2=$<<3*2=6>>6\nShe needs 4 cups of raspberries per quart of ice cream and the raspberries are sold in 2 cup packages. So 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 packages of raspberries\nThe raspberries cost $5 per package and she needs 2 so 5*2 = $<<5*2=10>>10\nEvery quart needs 2 cups of heavy cream and she's making 2 quarts so 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 quarts\nShe will spend $6 on strawberries, $10 on raspberries and $4 on heavy cream bringing the total to 6+10+4 = $<<6+10+4=22>>22\n#### 22",
