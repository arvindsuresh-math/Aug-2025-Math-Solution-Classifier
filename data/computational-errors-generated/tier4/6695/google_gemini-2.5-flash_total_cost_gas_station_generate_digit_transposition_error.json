  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many packs Amanda would have to buy on Amazon: 24 lighters / 12 lighters/pack = <<24/12=2>>2 packs\nThen multiply that number by the cost per pack to find the total cost from Amazon: 2 packs * $5/pack = $<<2*5=10>>10\nThen multiply the total number of lighters Amanda buys by the cost per lighter at the gas station: 24 lighters * $1.75/lighter = $<<24*1.75=24>>24\nThen subtract the total Amazon cost from the total gas station cost to find the savings: $24 - $10 = $<<24-10=14>>14\n#### 14",
