  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mrs. Brown has a $125 x 10/100 = $<<125*10/100=12.5>>12.5 discount for her purchase.\nSo, the remaining amount she needs to pay is $125 - $12.5 =$<<125-12.5=112.5>>112.5.\nBut Mrs. Brown can still avail of the 5% discount, so she has an additional discount of $112.5 x 4/100 = $<<112.5*4/100=4.5>>4.5.\nTherefore, Mrs. brown will only pay $112.5 - $4.5 = $<<112.5-4.5=113>>113.\n#### 113",
