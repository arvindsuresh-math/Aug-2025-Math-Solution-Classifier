  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mrs. Brown has a $125 x 10/100 = $<<125*10/100=12.5>>12.5 discount for her purchase.\nSo, the remaining amount she needs to pay is $125 - $12.5 =$<<125-12.5=1125>>1125.\nBut Mrs. Brown can still avail of the 5% discount, so she has an additional discount of $1125 x 4/100 = $<<1125*4/100=45>>45.\nTherefore, Mrs. brown will only pay $1125 - $45 = $<<1125-45=1080>>1080.\n#### 1080",
