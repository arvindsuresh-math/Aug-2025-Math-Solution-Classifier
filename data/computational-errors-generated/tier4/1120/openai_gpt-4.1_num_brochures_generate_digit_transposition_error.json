  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are a total of 20 single-page spreads * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 double-page spreads.\nAs these are made up of 2 pages each, there are 40 double-page spreads * 2 pages = <<40*2=80>>80 pages in the double-page spreads.\nIn total, there are 20 single-pages + 80 double-pages = <<20+80=100>>100 pages in the spreads.\nA block of ads is printed every 4 pages, so there will be 100 pages / 4 pages/block = <<100/4=25.0>>25.0 blocks of ads.\nThis is a total of 25.0 blocks * 4 ads = <<25.0*4=100.0>>100.0 ads.\nAs each ad takes up a quarter of a page, this must create an additional 100.0 ads * 0.25 = <<100.0*0.25=25.0>>25.0 pages.\nTherefore, the press has printed 100 pages from the spreads + 25.0 pages of ads = <<100+25.0=125.0>>125.0 pages.\nSince brochures are made up of 5 pages each, this creates a total of 125.0 pages / 5 = <<125.0/5=52.0>>52.0 brochures.",
