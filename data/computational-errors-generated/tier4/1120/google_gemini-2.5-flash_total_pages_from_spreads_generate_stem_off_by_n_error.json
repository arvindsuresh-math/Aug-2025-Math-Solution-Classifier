  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are a total of 20 single-page spreads * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 double-page spreads.\nAs these are made up of 2 pages each, there are 40 double-page spreads * 2 pages = <<40*2=80>>80 pages in the double-page spreads.\nIn total, there are 20 single-pages + 80 double-pages = <<20+80=120>>120 pages in the spreads.\nA block of ads is printed every 4 pages, so there will be 120 pages / 4 pages/block = <<120/4=30>>30 blocks of ads.\nThis is a total of 30 blocks * 4 ads = <<30*4=120>>120 ads.\nAs each ad takes up a quarter of a page, this must create an additional 120 ads * 0.25 = <<120*0.25=30>>30 pages.\nTherefore, the press has printed 120 pages from the spreads + 30 pages of ads = <<120+30=150>>150 pages.\nSince brochures are made up of 5 pages each, this creates a total of 150 pages / 5 = <<150/5=30>>30 brochures.\n#### 30",
