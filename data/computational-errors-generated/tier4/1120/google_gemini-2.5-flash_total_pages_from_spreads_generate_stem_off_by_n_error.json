  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are a total of 20 single-page spreads * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 double-page spreads.\nAs these are made up of 2 pages each, there are 40 double-page spreads * 2 pages = <<40*2=80>>80 pages in the double-page spreads.\nIn total, there are 20 single-pages + 80 double-pages = <<20+80=80>>80 pages in the spreads.\nA block of ads is printed every 4 pages, so there will be 80 pages / 4 pages/block = <<80/4=20.0>>20.0 blocks of ads.\nThis is a total of 20.0 blocks * 4 ads = <<20.0*4=80.0>>80.0 ads.\nAs each ad takes up a quarter of a page, this must create an additional 80.0 ads * 0.25 = <<80.0*0.25=20.0>>20.0 pages.\nTherefore, the press has printed 80 pages from the spreads + 20.0 pages of ads = <<80+20.0=100.0>>100.0 pages.\nSince brochures are made up of 5 pages each, this creates a total of 100.0 pages / 5 = <<100.0/5=20.0>>20.0 brochures.",
