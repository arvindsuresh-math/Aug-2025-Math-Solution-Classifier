  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are a total of 20 single-page spreads * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 double-page spreads.\nAs these are made up of 2 pages each, there are 40 double-page spreads * 2 pages = <<40*2=80>>80 pages in the double-page spreads.\nIn total, there are 20 single-pages + 80 double-pages = <<20+80=1000>>1000 pages in the spreads.\nA block of ads is printed every 4 pages, so there will be 1000 pages / 4 pages/block = <<1000/4=250>>250 blocks of ads.\nThis is a total of 250 blocks * 4 ads = <<250*4=1000>>1000 ads.\nAs each ad takes up a quarter of a page, this must create an additional 1000 ads * 0.25 = <<1000*0.25=250>>250 pages.\nTherefore, the press has printed 1000 pages from the spreads + 250 pages of ads = <<1000+250=1250>>1250 pages.\nSince brochures are made up of 5 pages each, this creates a total of 1250 pages / 5 = <<1250/5=250>>250 brochures.",
