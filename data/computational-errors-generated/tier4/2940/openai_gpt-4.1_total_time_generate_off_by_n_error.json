  "flawed_nl_solution": "The vehicle's speed decreases to 30 x 0.5 = <<30*0.5=15.0>>15.0 miles per hour when ascending to the top of the mountain.\nSo, the total time Crystal will have to spend going to the top of the mountain is 60 / 15.0 = <<60/15.0=4.0>>4.0 hours.\nAnd the speed of the vehicle increases by 30 x 0.2 = <<30*0.2=6.0>>6.0 miles per hour when going down to the foot of the mountain.\nSo, the total speed of the vehicle when going down is 30 + 6.0 = <<30+6.0=36.0>>36.0 miles per hour.\nThus, Chrystal will have to spend 72 / 36.0 = <<72/36.0=2.0>>2.0 hours to descend from the mountain.\nTherefore, the total hours she will spend to pass the whole mountain is 4.0 + 2.0 = <<4.0+2.0=11.0>>11.0 hours.",
