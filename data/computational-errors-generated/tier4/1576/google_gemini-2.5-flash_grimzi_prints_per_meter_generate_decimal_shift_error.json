  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Pogo leaves 4 prints per meter, then over 6000 meters it would leave 4*6000=<<4*6000=24000>>24000 footprints on the soils of Mars.\nGrimzi leaves 3 prints per 6 feet, or 3/6=0.05 footprints per meter.\nThen over 6000 meters, Grimzi leaves 0.05*6000=<<0.05*6000=300>>300 footprints on the sands of Pluto.\nIn total, the two creatures will leave 24000+300=<<24000+300=24300>>24300 footprints.\n#### 24300",
