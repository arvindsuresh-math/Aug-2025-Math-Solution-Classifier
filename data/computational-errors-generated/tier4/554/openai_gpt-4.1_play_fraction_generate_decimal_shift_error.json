  "flawed_nl_solution": "If 50% of individuals that like football play it, and there are 24 out of 60 individuals that like it, then 24*50% = 12.0 out of 60 individuals play it\nIf 12.0 individuals play it out of 60 individuals then that means only 12.0/60 = 1/5 or 2.0% play it\nIf 2.0% of individuals play football out of a group of 250 people, one would expect 250*2.0% = <<250*2.0*0.01=5.0>>5.0 individuals to play it",
