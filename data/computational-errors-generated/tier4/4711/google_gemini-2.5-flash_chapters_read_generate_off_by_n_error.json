  "flawed_nl_solution": "First divide 31 by 3, ignoring the remainder, to find how many chapters in the book are divisible by 3: 31 / 3 = 10.33..., which means 10 chapters are divisible by 3\nThen subtract that number from the total number of chapters to find how many chapters she reads: 31 chapters - 10 chapters = <<31-10=24>>24 chapters\nThen multiply the number chapters by the time to read each chapter to find the total time she spends reading: 24 chapters * 20 minutes/chapter = <<24*20=480>>480 minutes\nThen divide that time by the number of minutes per movie to find the total time spent reading in hours: 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<480/60=8>>8 hours\n#### 8",
