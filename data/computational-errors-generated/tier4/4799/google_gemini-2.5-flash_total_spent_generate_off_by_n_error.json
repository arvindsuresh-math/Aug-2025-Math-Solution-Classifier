  "flawed_nl_solution": "The school got a $150 x 5/100 = $<<150*5/100=7.5>>7.5 seminar fee discount for each teacher.\nEach teacher's seminar fee costs $150 - $7.5 = $<<150-7.5=142.5>>142.5.\nSo, 10 teachers' seminar fees cost $142.5 x 10 = $1425.\nThe food allowance for 10 teachers amounts to $10 x 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100.\nTherefore, the school spent a total of $1425 + $100 = $<<1425+100=1520>>1520.\n#### 1520",
