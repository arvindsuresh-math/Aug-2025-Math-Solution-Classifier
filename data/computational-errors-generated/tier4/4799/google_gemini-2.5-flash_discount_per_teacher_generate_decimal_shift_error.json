  "flawed_nl_solution": "The school got a $150 x 5/100 = $<<150*5/100=75>>75 seminar fee discount for each teacher.\nEach teacher's seminar fee costs $150 - $75 = $<<150-75=75>>75.\nSo, 10 teachers' seminar fees cost $75 x 10 = $750.\nThe food allowance for 10 teachers amounts to $10 x 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100.\nTherefore, the school spent a total of $750 + $100 = $<<750+100=850>>850.\n#### 850",
