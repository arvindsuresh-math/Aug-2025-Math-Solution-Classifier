  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to find the amount Matt read both years to establish what Pete read, so to find Matt's first-year total we multiply 75 / 1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 books the previous year.\nSince Pete read twice as many books as Matt did in the first year, and Matt's first-year total is 50, this means Pete read 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 books his first year.\nSince Pete doubled the number of books he read the following year, this means Pete read 100*2=<<100*2=2000>>2000 books the following year.\nWe add the two years of Pete's reading together to find 2000+100=<<2000+100=2100>>2100 books read in total.\n#### 2100",
