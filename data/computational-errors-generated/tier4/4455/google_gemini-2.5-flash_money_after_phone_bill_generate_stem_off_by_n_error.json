  "flawed_nl_solution": "Abigail had $20 + $40 = $<<20+40=90>>90 left after paying her phone bill.\nThe $90 is 100% - 25% = 75% of the remainder of her money after spending for food.\nSince 75% is $90, then 1% is $90/75 = $<<90/75=1.2>>1.2.\nThus, Abigail had $1.2 x 100 = $<<1.2*100=120>>120 left after she spent money on food.\nThe $120 is 100% - 60% = 40% of her original money.\nSo 1% is $120/40 = $<<120/40=3>>3.\nTherefore, Abigail initially had $3 x 100 = $<<3*100=300>>300.\n#### 300",
