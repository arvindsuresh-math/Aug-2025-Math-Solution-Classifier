  "flawed_nl_solution": "Abigail had $20 + $40 = $<<20+40=60>>60 left after paying her phone bill.\nThe $60 is 100% - 25% = 75% of the remainder of her money after spending for food.\nSince 75% is $60, then 1% is $60/75 = $<<60/75=0.8>>0.8.\nThus, Abigail had $0.8 x 100 = $<<0.8*100=80>>80 left after she spent money on food.\nThe $80 is 100% - 60% = 40% of her original money.\nSo 1% is $80/40 = $<<80/40=2>>2.\nTherefore, Abigail initially had $2 x 100 = $<<2*100=20>>20.\n#### 20",
