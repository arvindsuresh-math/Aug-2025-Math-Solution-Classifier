  "flawed_nl_solution": "The truck driver drives for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she drives 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles.\nTherefore, she needs 300/10=<<300/10=30.0>>30.0 gallons of gas.\nThis will cost her 30.0*$2=$<<30.0*2=60.0>>60.0.\nShe will make 300*$0.5= $<<300*0.5=105.0>>105.0.\nThus, after paying for gas, she will make $105.0-$60.0=$<<105.0-60.0=45.0>>45.0.",
