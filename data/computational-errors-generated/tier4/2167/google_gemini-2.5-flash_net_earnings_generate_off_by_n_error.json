  "flawed_nl_solution": "The truck driver drives for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she drives 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles.\nTherefore, she needs 300/10=<<300/10=30>>30 gallons of gas.\nThis will cost her 30*$2=$<<30*2=60>>60.\nShe will make 300*$0.5= $<<300*0.5=150>>150.\nThus, after paying for gas, she will make $150-$60=$<<150-60=92>>92.\n#### 92",
