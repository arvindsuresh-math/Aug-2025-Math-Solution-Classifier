  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of scrunchies: 6 barrettes * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 scrunchies\nThen subtract three fewer bobby pins than barrettes 6-3 =<<6-3=7>>7 bobby pins\nThen add the number of each type of hair decorations to find the total number: 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 7 decorations = <<6+12+7=25>>25 decorations\nThen divide the number of bobby pins by the total number of decorations and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 7 bobby pins / 25 decorations * 100% = 28.000000000000004 which rounds down to 28%",
