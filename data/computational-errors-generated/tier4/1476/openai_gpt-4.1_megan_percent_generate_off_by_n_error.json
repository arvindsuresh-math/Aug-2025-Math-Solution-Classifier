  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Kelly weighs 15% less than Megan, this means Kelly's weight is 100 - 15 = <<100-15=89>>89% of Megan's weight.\n89% is 0.85, so Megan weighs 34 / 0.85 = <<34/0.85=40.0>>40.0 kilograms.\nMike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan, so he weighs 40.0 + 5 = <<40.0+5=45.0>>45.0 kilograms.\nIn total all three kids weigh 34 + 40.0 + 45.0 = <<34+40.0+45.0=119.0>>119.0 kilograms.\nThat means to cross the bridge safely, they weigh 119.0 - 100 = <<119.0-100=19.0>>19.0 kilograms too much.",
