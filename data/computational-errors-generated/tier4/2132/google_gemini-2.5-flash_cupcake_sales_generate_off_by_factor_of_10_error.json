  "flawed_nl_solution": "The basketball team earned 50 x $2 = $1000 from selling cupcakes.\nThey also earned 40 x 0.5 = $20 from selling cookies.\nSo their total earnings was $1000 + $20 = $1020.\nThe two basketballs cost $40 x 2 = $80.\nThus, $1020 - $80 = $940 was used to buy the 20 bottles of energy drinks.\nTherefore, each bottle of energy drink costs $940/20 = $47.\n#### 47",
