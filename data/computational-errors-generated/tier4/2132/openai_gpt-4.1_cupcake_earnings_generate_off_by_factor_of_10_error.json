  "flawed_nl_solution": "The basketball team earned 50 x $2 = $<<50*2=1000>>1000 from selling cupcakes.\nThey also earned 40 x 0.5 = $<<40*0.5=20.0>>20.0 from selling cookies.\nSo their total earnings was $1000 + $20.0 = $<<1000+20.0=1020.0>>1020.0.\nThe two basketballs cost $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80.\nThus, $1020.0 - $80 = $<<1020.0-80=940.0>>940.0 was used to buy the 20 bottles of energy drinks.\nTherefore, each bottle of energy drink costs $940.0/20 = $<<940.0/20=47.0>>47.0.",
