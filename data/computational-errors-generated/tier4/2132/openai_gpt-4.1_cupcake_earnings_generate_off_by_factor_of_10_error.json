  "flawed_nl_solution": "The basketball team earned 50 x $2 = $<<50*2=1000>>1000 from selling cupcakes.\nThey also earned 40 x 0.5 = $<<40*0.5=20>>20 from selling cookies.\nSo their total earnings was $1000 + $20 = $<<1000+20=1020>>1020.\nThe two basketballs cost $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80.\nThus, $1020 - $80 = $<<1020-80=940>>940 was used to buy the 20 bottles of energy drinks.\nTherefore, each bottle of energy drink costs $940/20 = $<<940/20=47>>47.\n#### 47",
