  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, calculate how many square feet of road Mark needs to cover by multiplying the length by the width: 2000 feet * 20 feet = <<2000*20=40000>>40000 sq ft\nThen divide the square footage of road by the number of square feet each truckload will cover: 40000 sq ft / 800 sq ft/truckload = <<40000/800=50>>50 truckloads\nNow multiply the number of truckloads by the cost per truckload: $75/truckload * 50 truckloads = $<<75*50=3570>>3570\nNow calculate the sales tax by multiplying $3570 by 20%: $3570 * 0.2 = $<<3570*0.2=714>>714\nNow add the sales tax to the cost of the asphalt to find the total: $714 + $3570 = $<<714+3570=4284>>4284\n#### 4284",
