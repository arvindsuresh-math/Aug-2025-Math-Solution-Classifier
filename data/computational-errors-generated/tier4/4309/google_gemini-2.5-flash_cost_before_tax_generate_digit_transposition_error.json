  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, calculate how many square feet of road Mark needs to cover by multiplying the length by the width: 2000 feet * 20 feet = <<2000*20=40000>>40000 sq ft\nThen divide the square footage of road by the number of square feet each truckload will cover: 40000 sq ft / 800 sq ft/truckload = <<40000/800=50>>50 truckloads\nNow multiply the number of truckloads by the cost per truckload: $75/truckload * 50 truckloads = $<<75*50=7350>>7350\nNow calculate the sales tax by multiplying $7350 by 20%: $7350 * 0.2 = $<<7350*0.2=1470>>1470\nNow add the sales tax to the cost of the asphalt to find the total: $1470 + $7350 = $<<1470+7350=8820>>8820\n#### 8820",
