  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, calculate how many square feet of road Mark needs to cover by multiplying the length by the width: 2000 feet * 20 feet = <<2000*20=4000>>4000 sq ft\nThen divide the square footage of road by the number of square feet each truckload will cover: 4000 sq ft / 800 sq ft/truckload = <<4000/800=5>>5 truckloads\nNow multiply the number of truckloads by the cost per truckload: $75/truckload * 5 truckloads = $<<75*5=375>>375\nNow calculate the sales tax by multiplying $375 by 20%: $375 * 0.2 = $<<375*0.2=75>>75\nNow add the sales tax to the cost of the asphalt to find the total: $75 + $375 = $<<75+375=450>>450\n#### 450",
