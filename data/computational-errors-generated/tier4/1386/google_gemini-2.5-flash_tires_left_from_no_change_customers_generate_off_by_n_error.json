  "flawed_nl_solution": "A total of 4 + 6 = <<4+6=10>>10 cars are in the shop throughout the week.\nThis means the shop buys 10 cars * 4 tires = <<10*4=40>>40 tires.\nFor each of the customers that only want half the tires changing, there are 4 tires * 0.5 = <<4*0.5=2>>2 tires left over.\nTwo of the customers only want half the tires changing, so there are 2 tires * 2 cars = <<2*2=4>>4 tires left over from these customers.\nOut of the remaining tires, there are 20 - 4 = <<20-4=20>>20 tires left from customers who don't want their tires changing.\nSo in total, there were 20 tires / 4 tires per customer = <<20/4=5>>5 customers who did not want their tires changing.\n#### 5",
