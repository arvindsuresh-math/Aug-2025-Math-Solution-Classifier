  "flawed_nl_solution": "A total of 4 + 6 = <<4+6=6>>6 cars are in the shop throughout the week.\nThis means the shop buys 6 cars * 4 tires = <<6*4=24>>24 tires.\nFor each of the customers that only want half the tires changing, there are 4 tires * 0.5 = <<4*0.5=2.0>>2.0 tires left over.\nTwo of the customers only want half the tires changing, so there are 2.0 tires * 2 cars = <<2.0*2=4.0>>4.0 tires left over from these customers.\nOut of the remaining tires, there are 20 - 4.0 = <<20-4.0=16.0>>16.0 tires left from customers who don't want their tires changing.\nSo in total, there were 16.0 tires / 4 tires per customer = <<16.0/4=4.0>>4.0 customers who did not want their tires changing.",
