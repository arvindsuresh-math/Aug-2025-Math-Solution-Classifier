  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Jemma sold 400 glasses frames at $5 each, she made 400*$5 = $<<400*5=2000>>2000\nJemma sold twice as many frames as Dorothy, meaning Dorothy sold 400/2 = 200 frames.\nIf Dorothy sold her glasses frames at half the price that Jemma sold hers, then it means she sold her glasses frames at $5/2 = $<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 per glasses frame.\nIn total, Dorothy made $2.5*200 = $<<2.5*200=50>>50 from the sale of her glasses frames.\nTogether, they made $2000+$50 = $<<2000+50=2050>>2050 from the sale of the glasses frames.\n#### 2050",
