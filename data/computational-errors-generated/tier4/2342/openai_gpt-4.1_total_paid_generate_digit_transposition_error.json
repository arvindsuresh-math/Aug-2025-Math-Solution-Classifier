  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 5% discount amounts to $50 x 5/100 = $<<50*5*0.01=2.5>>2.5.\nSo the total discount given to the customer for 4 months was $2.5 x 4 = $<<2.5*4=10>>10.\nThe customer was supposed to pay $50 x 4 = $<<50*4=200>>200 in all for 4 months without discount.\nSince the customer is entitled to the discount, then he only paid a total of $200 - $10 = $<<200-10=109>>109 for 4 months.\n#### 109",
