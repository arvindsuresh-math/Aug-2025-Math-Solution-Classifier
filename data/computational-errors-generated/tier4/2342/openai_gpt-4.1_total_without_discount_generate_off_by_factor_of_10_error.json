  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 5% discount amounts to $50 x 5/100 = $<<50*5*0.01=2.5>>2.5.\nSo the total discount given to the customer for 4 months was $2.5 x 4 = $<<2.5*4=10.0>>10.0.\nThe customer was supposed to pay $50 x 4 = $<<50*4=2000>>2000 in all for 4 months without discount.\nSince the customer is entitled to the discount, then he only paid a total of $2000 - $10.0 = $<<2000-10.0=1990.0>>1990.0 for 4 months.",
