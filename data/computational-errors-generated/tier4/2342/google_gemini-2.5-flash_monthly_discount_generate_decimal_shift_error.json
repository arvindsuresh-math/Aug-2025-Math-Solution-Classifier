  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 5% discount amounts to $50 x 5/100 = $<<50*5/100=25.0>>25.0.\nSo the total discount given to the customer for 4 months was $25.0 x 4 = $<<25.0*4=100.0>>100.0.\nThe customer was supposed to pay $50 x 4 = $<<50*4=200>>200 in all for 4 months without discount.\nSince the customer is entitled to the discount, then he only paid a total of $200 - $100.0 = $<<200-100.0=100.0>>100.0 for 4 months.",
