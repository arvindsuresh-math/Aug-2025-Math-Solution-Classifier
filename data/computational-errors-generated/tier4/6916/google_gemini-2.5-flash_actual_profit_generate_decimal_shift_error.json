  "flawed_nl_solution": "The store made a $50 x 30/100 = $<<50*30/100=15>>15 profit for selling it 30% above the cost.\nSo, the book was sold for $50 + $15 = $<<50+15=65>>65.\nDuring a sale, the book's selling price decreased by $65 x 10/100 = $<<65*10/100=6.5>>6.5.\nSo, the book was sold for $65 - $6.5 = $<<65-6.5=58.5>>58.5.\nThere was $58.5 - $50 = $<<58.5-50=85>>85 profit after the discount.\nTherefore, the percent profit is $85/$50 x 100% = <<85/50*100=170>>170%.\n#### 170",
