  "flawed_nl_solution": "The store made a $50 x 30/100 = $<<50*30/100=15>>15 profit for selling it 30% above the cost.\nSo, the book was sold for $50 + $15 = $<<50+15=65>>65.\nDuring a sale, the book's selling price decreased by $65 x 10/100 = $<<65*10/100=6.5>>6.5.\nSo, the book was sold for $65 - $6.5 = $<<65-6.5=585>>585.\nThere was $585 - $50 = $<<585-50=535>>535 profit after the discount.\nTherefore, the percent profit is $535/$50 x 100% = <<535/50*100=1070>>1070%.\n#### 1070",
