  "flawed_nl_solution": "The store made a $50 x 30/100 = $<<50*30/100=15>>15 profit for selling it 30% above the cost.\nSo, the book was sold for $50 + $15 = $<<50+15=60>>60.\nDuring a sale, the book's selling price decreased by $60 x 10/100 = $<<60*10/100=6>>6.\nSo, the book was sold for $60 - $6 = $<<60-6=54>>54.\nThere was $54 - $50 = $<<54-50=4>>4 profit after the discount.\nTherefore, the percent profit is $4/$50 x 100% = <<4/50*100=8>>8%.\n#### 8",
