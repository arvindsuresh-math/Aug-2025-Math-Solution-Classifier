  "flawed_nl_solution": "The store made a $50 x 30/100 = $<<50*30/100=15>>15 profit for selling it 30% above the cost.\nSo, the book was sold for $50 + $15 = $<<50+15=70>>70.\nDuring a sale, the book's selling price decreased by $70 x 10/100 = $<<70*10/100=7>>7.\nSo, the book was sold for $70 - $7 = $<<70-7=63>>63.\nThere was $63 - $50 = $<<63-50=13>>13 profit after the discount.\nTherefore, the percent profit is $13/$50 x 100% = <<13/50*100=26>>26%.\n#### 26",
