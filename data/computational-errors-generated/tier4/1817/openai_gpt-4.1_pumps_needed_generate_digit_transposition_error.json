  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, if the a full tire needs 500 cubic inches of air, then two empty tires need: 500 cubic inches/tire * 2 tires = <<500*2=1000>>1000 cubic inches.\nSo, we find the 40%-full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (60%) = <<500*(60*0.01)=300>>300 cubic inches.\nSo, the 70%-full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (30%)= <<500*(30*0.01)=150>>150 cubic inches.\nNow add up the needs of all the tires to find the total number of cubic inches needed: 1000 cubic inches + 300 cubic inches + 150 cubic inches = <<1000+300+150=1450>>1450 cubic inches.\nFinally, if the pumps each hold 50 cubic inches, the total number of pumps needed is 1450 cubic inches / 50 cubic inches/pump = 92 pumps.\n#### 92",
