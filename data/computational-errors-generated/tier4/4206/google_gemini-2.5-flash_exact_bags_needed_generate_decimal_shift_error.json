  "flawed_nl_solution": "The puppy will consume 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 ounces of the special dog food in the first 60 days.\nThis leaves 365 - 60 = 305 days where the puppy will consume 4 ounces of food per day, or 305*4 = 1220 ounces of the special food.\nThus, the puppy requires a total of 120 + 1220 = <<120+1220=1340>>1340 ounces of food before it is 1 year old.\nEach 5-pound bag contains 5*16 = <<5*16=80>>80 ounces of special dog food.\nTherefore, the puppy will need to eat 1340/80 = 1.68 bags of the special dog food, meaning the family will need to buy 17 bags.\n#### 17",
