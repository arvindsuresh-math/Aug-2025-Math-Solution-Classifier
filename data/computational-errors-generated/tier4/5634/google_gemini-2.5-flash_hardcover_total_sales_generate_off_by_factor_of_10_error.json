  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total earnings for the paper cover version were $0.2 x 32000 = $<<0.2*32000=6400>>6400.\nSo, the author earned $6400 x 6/100 = $384 from the paper cover version.\nThe total earnings for the hardcover version were $0.4 x 15000 = $<<0.4*15000=60000>>60000.\nSo, the author earned $60000 x 12/100 = $<<60000*12/100=7200>>7200 from the hardcover version.\nTherefore, the author earned a total of $384 + $7200 = $<<384+7200=7584>>7584.\n#### 7584",
