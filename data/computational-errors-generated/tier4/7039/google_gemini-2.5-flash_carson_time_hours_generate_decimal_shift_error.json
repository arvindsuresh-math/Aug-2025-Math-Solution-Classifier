  "flawed_nl_solution": "We know that Carson takes twice as long as Jerry to get to the school, so we can find the time it takes him by multiplying Jerry's time by 2: 15 minutes * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 minutes\nThen convert that time to house by dividing by 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=0.05>>0.05 hour\nThen divide the distance Carson runs by the time it takes him to run it to find his speed: 4 miles / 0.05 hours = <<4/0.05=80>>80 miles/hour\n#### 80",
