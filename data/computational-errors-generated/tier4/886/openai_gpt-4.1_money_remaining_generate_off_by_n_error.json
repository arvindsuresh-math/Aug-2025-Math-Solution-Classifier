  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jack's mother asked him to buy 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 bottles of water.\nThus Jack bought 4 + 8 = <<4+8=12>>12 bottles of water in total.\nAltogether, the bottles of water cost 12 * $2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.\nThe cheese cost 0.5 * $10 = $<<10*0.5=5.0>>5.0.\nSo Jack spent $24 + $5.0 = $<<24+5.0=29.0>>29.0 on water and cheese.\nSince he started with $100, he now has $100 - $29.0 = $<<100-29.0=68.0>>68.0 left.",
