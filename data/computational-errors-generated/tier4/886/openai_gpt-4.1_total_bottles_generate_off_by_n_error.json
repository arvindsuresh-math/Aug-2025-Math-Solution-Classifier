  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jack's mother asked him to buy 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 bottles of water.\nThus Jack bought 4 + 8 = <<4+8=7>>7 bottles of water in total.\nAltogether, the bottles of water cost 7 * $2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.\nThe cheese cost 0.5 * $10 = $<<10*0.5=5.0>>5.0.\nSo Jack spent $14 + $5.0 = $<<14+5.0=19.0>>19.0 on water and cheese.\nSince he started with $100, he now has $100 - $19.0 = $<<100-19.0=81.0>>81.0 left.",
