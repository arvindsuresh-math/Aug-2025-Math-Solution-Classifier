  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jack's mother asked him to buy 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 bottles of water.\nThus Jack bought 4 + 8 = <<4+8=9>>9 bottles of water in total.\nAltogether, the bottles of water cost 9 * $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18.\nThe cheese cost 0.5 * $10 = $<<10*0.5=5>>5.\nSo Jack spent $18 + $5 = $<<18+5=23>>23 on water and cheese.\nSince he started with $100, he now has $100 - $23 = $<<100-23=77>>77 left.",
