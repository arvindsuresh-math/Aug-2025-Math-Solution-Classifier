  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jack's mother asked him to buy 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 bottles of water.\nThus Jack bought 4 + 8 = <<4+8=10>>10 bottles of water in total.\nAltogether, the bottles of water cost 10 * $2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nThe cheese cost 1/2 * $10 = $<<10*0.5=5>>5.\nSo Jack spent $20 + $5 = $<<20+5=25>>25 on water and cheese.\nSince he started with $100, he now has $100 - $25 = $<<100-25=75>>75 left.\n#### 75",
