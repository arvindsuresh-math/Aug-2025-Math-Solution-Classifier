  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jack's mother asked him to buy 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 bottles of water.\nThus Jack bought 4 + 8 = <<4+8=14>>14 bottles of water in total.\nAltogether, the bottles of water cost 14 * $2 = $<<14*2=28>>28.\nThe cheese cost 1/2 * $10 = $<<10*0.5=5>>5.\nSo Jack spent $28 + $5 = $<<28+5=33>>33 on water and cheese.\nSince he started with $100, he now has $100 - $33 = $<<100-33=67>>67 left.\n#### 67",
