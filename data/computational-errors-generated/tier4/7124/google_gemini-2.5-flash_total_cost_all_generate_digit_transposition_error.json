  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the initial price of orange was $40, after the increase, the price rose by 15/100*$40 = $<<40*15/100=6>>6\nThe total price of buying an orange at the new price is $6+$40 = $<<6+40=46>>46\nFor the mango, the price increased by 15/100*$50 = <<15/100*50=7.5>>7.5\nThe price of purchasing a mango at the new price is $50+$7.5 = <<50+7.5=57.5>>57.5\nTo buy ten oranges it would cost $46*10 = $<<46*10=460>>460\nTo buy 10 mangoes, it now costs $57.5*10 = $<<57.5*10=575>>575\nThe total cost of buying ten oranges and ten mangoes is $575+$460 = $<<1053=1053>>1053\n#### 1053",
