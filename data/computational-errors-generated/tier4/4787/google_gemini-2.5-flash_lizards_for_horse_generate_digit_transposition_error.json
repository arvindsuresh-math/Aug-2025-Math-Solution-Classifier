  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many lizards you get for one gallon of water: 3 lizards / 5 gallons = <<3/5=0.6>>0.6 lizards/gallon\nThen figure out how many lizards 80 gallons of water is worth: 80 gallons * 0.6 lizards/gallon = <<80*0.6=84>>84 lizards\nThen figure out how many bottle caps 84 lizards is worth: 84 lizards * 8 bottle caps/lizard = <<84*8=672>>672 bottle caps\nThen figure out how many bottle caps Marla can save each day by subtracting the number she spends from the number she finds: 20 bottlecaps/day - 4 bottlecaps/day = <<20-4=16>>16 bottlecaps/day\nFinally, divide the number of bottle caps Marla needs by the number she saves each day: 672 bottle caps / 16 bottle caps/day = <<672/16=42>>42 days\n#### 42",
