  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many lizards you get for one gallon of water: 3 lizards / 5 gallons = <<3/5=0.6>>0.6 lizards/gallon\nThen figure out how many lizards 80 gallons of water is worth: 80 gallons * 0.6 lizards/gallon = <<80*0.6=48>>48 lizards\nThen figure out how many bottle caps 48 lizards is worth: 48 lizards * 8 bottle caps/lizard = <<48*8=384>>384 bottle caps\nThen figure out how many bottle caps Marla can save each day by subtracting the number she spends from the number she finds: 20 bottlecaps/day - 4 bottlecaps/day = <<20-4=12>>12 bottlecaps/day\nFinally, divide the number of bottle caps Marla needs by the number she saves each day: 384 bottle caps / 12 bottle caps/day = <<384/12=32>>32 days\n#### 32",
