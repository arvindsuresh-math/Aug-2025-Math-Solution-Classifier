  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200.0>>1200.0.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000.0>>4000.0.\nThus, her total earning is $1200.0 + $4000.0 = $<<1200.0+4000.0=5200.0>>5200.0.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $5200.0 x 95/100 = $<<5200.0*95/100=4940.0>>4940.0.\nTherefore, she allocated $5200.0 - $4940.0 = $<<5200.0-4940.0=262.0>>262.0 on insurance.",
