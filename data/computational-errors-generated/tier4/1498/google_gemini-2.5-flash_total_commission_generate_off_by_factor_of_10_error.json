  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=400>>400.\nThus, her total earning is $1200 + $400 = $<<1200+400=1600>>1600.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $1600 x 95/100 = $<<1600*95/100=1520>>1520.\nTherefore, she allocated $1600 - $1520 = $<<1600-1520=80>>80 on insurance.",
