  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200.0>>1200.0.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=400.0>>400.0.\nThus, her total earning is $1200.0 + $400.0 = $<<1200.0+400.0=1600.0>>1600.0.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $1600.0 x 95/100 = $<<1600.0*95/100=1520.0>>1520.0.\nTherefore, she allocated $1600.0 - $1520.0 = $<<1600.0-1520.0=80.0>>80.0 on insurance.",
