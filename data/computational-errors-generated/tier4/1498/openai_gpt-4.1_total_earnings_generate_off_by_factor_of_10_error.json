  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nThus, her total earning is $1200 + $4000 = $<<1200+4000=520>>520.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $520 x 95/100 = $<<520*95/100=494>>494.\nTherefore, she allocated $520 - $494 = $<<520-494=26>>26 on insurance.\n#### 26",
