  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nThus, her total earning is $1200 + $4000 = $<<1200+4000=5200>>5200.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $5200 x 95/100 = $<<5200*95/100=4904>>4904.\nTherefore, she allocated $5200 - $4904 = $<<5200-4904=296>>296 on insurance.",
