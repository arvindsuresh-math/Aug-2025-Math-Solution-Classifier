  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nThus, her total earning is $1200 + $4000 = $<<1200+4000=2500>>2500.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $2500 x 95/100 = $<<2500*95/100=2375>>2375.\nTherefore, she allocated $2500 - $2375 = $<<2500-2375=125>>125 on insurance.\n#### 125",
