  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=12000>>12000.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nThus, her total earning is $12000 + $4000 = $<<12000+4000=16000>>16000.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $16000 x 95/100 = $<<16000*95/100=15200>>15200.\nTherefore, she allocated $16000 - $15200 = $<<16000-15200=800>>800 on insurance.",
