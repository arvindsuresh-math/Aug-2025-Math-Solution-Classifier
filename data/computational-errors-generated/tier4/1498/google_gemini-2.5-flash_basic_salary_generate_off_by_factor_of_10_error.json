  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=120.0>>120.0.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000.0>>4000.0.\nThus, her total earning is $120.0 + $4000.0 = $<<120.0+4000.0=4120.0>>4120.0.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $4120.0 x 95/100 = $<<4120.0*95/100=3914.0>>3914.0.\nTherefore, she allocated $4120.0 - $3914.0 = $<<4120.0-3914.0=206.0>>206.0 on insurance.",
