  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=2100>>2100.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nThus, her total earning is $2100 + $4000 = $<<2100+4000=6100>>6100.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $6100 x 95/100 = $<<6100*95/100=5795>>5795.\nTherefore, she allocated $6100 - $5795 = $<<6100-5795=305>>305 on insurance.\n#### 305",
