  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1020>>1020.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nThus, her total earning is $1020 + $4000 = $<<1020+4000=5020>>5020.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $5020 x 95/100 = $<<5020*95/100=4769>>4769.\nTherefore, she allocated $5020 - $4769 = $<<5020-4769=251>>251 on insurance.\n#### 251",
