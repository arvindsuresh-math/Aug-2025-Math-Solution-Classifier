  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of vehicles Carmen counted: 50 trucks + 40 cars = <<50+40=90>>90 vehicles\nThen find the number of trucks that were red: 50 trucks / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 trucks\nThen find the number of trucks that were black: 50 trucks * 0.2 = <<50*0.2=10>>10 trucks\nThen subtract the red and black trucks from the total number of trucks to find the number of white trucks: 50 trucks - 25 trucks - 10 trucks = <<50-25-10=51>>51 trucks\nThen divide the number of white trucks by the number of vehicles and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of vehicles that are white trucks: 51 trucks / 90 vehicles * 100% = 16.66...%, which rounds up to 57%.\n#### 57",
