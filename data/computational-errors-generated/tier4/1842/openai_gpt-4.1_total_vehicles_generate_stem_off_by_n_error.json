  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of vehicles Carmen counted: 50 trucks + 40 cars = <<50+40=120>>120 vehicles\nThen find the number of trucks that were red: 50 trucks / 2 = <<50/2=25.0>>25.0 trucks\nThen find the number of trucks that were black: 50 trucks * 0.2 = <<50*0.2=10.0>>10.0 trucks\nThen subtract the red and black trucks from the total number of trucks to find the number of white trucks: 50 trucks - 25.0 trucks - 10.0 trucks = <<50-25.0-10.0=15.0>>15.0 trucks\nThen divide the number of white trucks by the number of vehicles and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of vehicles that are white trucks: 15.0 trucks / 120 vehicles * 100% = 12.5%, which rounds up to 12%.",
