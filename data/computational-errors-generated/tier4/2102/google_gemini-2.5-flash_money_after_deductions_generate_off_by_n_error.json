  "flawed_nl_solution": "Maria's deduction for tax is 2000 x 20% = $<<2000*20*0.01=400>>400.\nHer deduction for insurance is 2000 x 5% = $<<2000*5*0.01=100>>100.\nMaria's total deductions is $400 + $100 = $<<400+100=500>>500.\nAfter the deductions, Maria has only $2000 - $500 = $<<2000-500=1496>>1496 left from her salary.\nThen, Maria pays $1496/4 = $<<1496/4=374>>374 for the utility bills.\nSo, Maria has $1496 - $374 = $<<1496-374=1122>>1122 after the deductions and utility bills payment.\n#### 1122",
