  "flawed_nl_solution": "Maria's deduction for tax is 2000 x 20% = $<<2000*20*0.01=400>>400.\nHer deduction for insurance is 2000 x 5% = $<<2000*5*0.01=1000>>1000.\nMaria's total deductions is $400 + $1000 = $<<400+1000=1400>>1400.\nAfter the deductions, Maria has only $2000 - $1400 = $<<2000-1400=600>>600 left from her salary.\nThen, Maria pays $600/4 = $<<600/4=150>>150 for the utility bills.\nSo, Maria has $600 - $150 = $<<600-150=450>>450 after the deductions and utility bills payment.\n#### 450",
