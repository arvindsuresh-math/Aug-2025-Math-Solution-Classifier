  "flawed_nl_solution": "Maria's deduction for tax is 2000 x 20% = $<<2000*20*0.01=400>>400.\nHer deduction for insurance is 2000 x 5% = $<<2000*5*0.01=100>>100.\nMaria's total deductions is $400 + $100 = $<<400+100=500>>500.\nAfter the deductions, Maria has only $2000 - $500 = $<<2000-500=1500>>1500 left from her salary.\nThen, Maria pays $1500/4 = $<<1500/4=375>>375 for the utility bills.\nSo, Maria has $1500 - $375 = $<<1500-375=1130>>1130 after the deductions and utility bills payment.",
