  "flawed_nl_solution": "Maria's deduction for tax is 2000 x 20% = $<<2000*20*0.01=400.0>>400.0.\nHer deduction for insurance is 2000 x 5% = $<<2000*5*0.01=100.0>>100.0.\nMaria's total deductions is $400.0 + $100.0 = $<<400.0+100.0=500.0>>500.0.\nAfter the deductions, Maria has only $2000 - $500.0 = $<<2000-500.0=15000.0>>15000.0 left from her salary.\nThen, Maria pays $15000.0/4 = $<<15000.0/4=3750.0>>3750.0 for the utility bills.\nSo, Maria has $15000.0 - $3750.0 = $<<15000.0-3750.0=11250.0>>11250.0 after the deductions and utility bills payment.",
