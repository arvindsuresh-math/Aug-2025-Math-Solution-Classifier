  "flawed_nl_solution": "Maria's deduction for tax is 2000 x 20% = $<<2000*20*0.01=40>>40.\nHer deduction for insurance is 2000 x 5% = $<<2000*5*0.01=100>>100.\nMaria's total deductions is $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.\nAfter the deductions, Maria has only $2000 - $140 = $<<2000-140=1860>>1860 left from her salary.\nThen, Maria pays $1860/4 = $<<1860/4=465>>465 for the utility bills.\nSo, Maria has $1860 - $465 = $<<1860-465=1395>>1395 after the deductions and utility bills payment.\n#### 1395",
