  "flawed_nl_solution": "First we must determine the percentage of the grey and green stones. We add the two amounts together, finding 40+60=<<40+60=100>>100\nWe then figure out that 40/100=<<40/100=0.4>>0.4, meaning 40 percent of the stones are grey in the second selection.\nThis means that 1-0.4= <<1-0.4=6>>6, or 60 percent of the stones are green.\nTherefore, to find the number of white stones we multiply 100*6= 600 white stones.\n#### 600",
