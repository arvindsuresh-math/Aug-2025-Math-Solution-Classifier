  "flawed_nl_solution": "First we must determine the percentage of the grey and green stones. We add the two amounts together, finding 40+60=<<40+60=80>>80\nWe then figure out that 40/80=<<40/80=0.5>>0.5, meaning 40 percent of the stones are grey in the second selection.\nThis means that 1-0.5= <<1-0.5=0.5>>0.5, or 60 percent of the stones are green.\nTherefore, to find the number of white stones we multiply 100*0.5= 50 white stones.\n#### 50",
