  "flawed_nl_solution": "The height of the sunflowers from Packet A is the same as the height of the sunflowers from Packet B + {percent_taller*100}%. If Y represents the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, Y + 0.2Y = the height of sunflowers from Packet A.\nWe know the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches = Y + 0.2Y or 12Y.\nTo figure out Y, we would divide both sides of the equation by 12, like this: 192 / 12 = 12Y / 12 or 16 = Y.",
