  "flawed_nl_solution": "First we need to determine the bonus percentage, which is found by dividing the bonus amount by the amount John made for the year, taking 10000/100000= <<10000/100000=1.0>>1.0, or 10 percent.\nThen, we take John's earnings from this year and multiply them by the same percentage, taking 200000*1.0= 200000.0 dollars in bonuses\nWe then add these two numbers together, for a total of 200000+200000.0= <<200000+200000.0=400000.0>>400000.0 dollars.",
