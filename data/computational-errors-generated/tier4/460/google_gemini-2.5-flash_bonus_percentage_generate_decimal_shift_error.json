  "flawed_nl_solution": "First we need to determine the bonus percentage, which is found by dividing the bonus amount by the amount John made for the year, taking 10000/100000= <<10000/100000=0.01>>0.01, or 10 percent.\nThen, we take John's earnings from this year and multiply them by the same percentage, taking 200000*0.01= 2000 dollars in bonuses\nWe then add these two numbers together, for a total of 200000+2000= <<200000+2000=202000>>202000 dollars.\n#### 202000",
