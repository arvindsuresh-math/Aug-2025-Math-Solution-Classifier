  "flawed_nl_solution": "Gary earned overtime, so he worked at least 40 hours. for which he was paid 40 hours * $12/hour = $<<40*12=480>>480 at his normal wage.\nThis means that $696 - $480 = $<<696-480=216>>216 was earned at his overtime wage.\nHis overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $<<12*1.5=18.0>>18.0 per hour.\nSo Gary worked $216 / $18.0 per hour = <<216/18.0=12.0>>12.0 hours' worth of overtime.\nSo in total, Gary worked 40 hours + 12.0 hours = <<40+12.0=47.0>>47.0 hours that week.",
