  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of games Bill has won: 200 games * 63% = <<200*63*0.01=126>>126 games\nThen find how many of the next 100 games he wins by subtracting the number he loses from the total: 100 games - 43 games = <<100-43=75>>75 games\nThen add his new wins to his old wins to find his total wins: 75 games + 126 games = <<75+126=201>>201 games\nThen add the old total number of games to the new total number of games to find the overall total number of games: 200 games + 100 games = <<200+100=300>>300 games\nThen divide the total number of games Bill won by the overall total number of games and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of games he won: 201 games / 300 games * 100% = 67%\n#### 67",
