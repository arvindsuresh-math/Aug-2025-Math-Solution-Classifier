# Calculate the distance traveled after the first two turns.
distance_after_first_two_turns = 5 + 8

# Calculate the distance traveled after the third turn.
# The total distance is 23 meters.
# The distance after the first two turns is 13 meters (5 + 8).
# The car exits immediately after the 4th turn, so no distance is traveled after the 4th turn.
distance_after_third_turn = 23 - (distance_after_first_two_turns)
