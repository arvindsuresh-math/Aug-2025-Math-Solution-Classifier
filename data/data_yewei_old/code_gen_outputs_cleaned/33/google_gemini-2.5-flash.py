    water_cups = 10
    flour_cups = 16

    # The problem asks for the combined total number of cups of water, cups of flour, and teaspoons of salt.
    # This implies summing the numerical values regardless of unit, as is common in these types of problems.
    combined_total = water_cups + flour_cups + salt_teaspoons
