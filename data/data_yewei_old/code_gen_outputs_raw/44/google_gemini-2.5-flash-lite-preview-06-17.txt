```python
# Calculate the amount spent on food
food_cost = 0.30 * 1000

# Calculate the amount spent on accommodation
accommodation_cost = 0.15 * 1000

# Calculate the amount spent on entertainment
entertainment_cost = 0.25 * 1000

# Calculate the total amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment
total_spent_known = food_cost + accommodation_cost + entertainment_cost

# Calculate the amount spent on coursework materials
coursework_materials_cost = 1000 - total_spent_known
