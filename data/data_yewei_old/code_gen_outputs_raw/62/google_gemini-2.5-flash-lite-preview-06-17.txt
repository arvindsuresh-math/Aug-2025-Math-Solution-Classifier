```python
# Calculate the total amount of oil in the first 10 cans
oil_in_first_10_cans = 10 * 8

# Calculate the remaining amount of oil
remaining_oil = 290 - oil_in_first_10_cans

# Calculate the number of remaining cans
remaining_cans = 24 - 10

# Calculate the amount of oil in each of the remaining cans
oil_per_remaining_can = remaining_oil / remaining_cans

# Print the result
