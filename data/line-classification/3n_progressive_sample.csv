"You are an expert in mathematical problem solving. Analyze the following mathematical problem and solution to identify whether there are any errors. At the end of every line, ask yourself- 'Is the solution correct so far? In particular, have there been any computational errors, or misinterpretations of the problem, or any flaws in the logic?' You must carefully examine it line-by-line because it is important to detect the VERY FIRST LINE WITH AN ERROR.

### Problem:
Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?

### Solution:
Weng earns 12/60 = $0.2 per minute.<|LINE_SEP|>Working 50 minutes, she earned 50 x 50 = $2500.<|LINE_SEP|>#### 2500<|LINE_SEP|>","Weng earns 12/60 = $0.2 per minute.

### Problem:
Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?

### Solution:
In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $50.<|LINE_SEP|>Betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $30.<|LINE_SEP|>This means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 = $20 more.<|LINE_SEP|>#### 20<|LINE_SEP|>","In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $50.

### Problem:
Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?

### Problem:
A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?

### Solution:
Let S be the number of people on the first hundred years' ship.<|LINE_SEP|>The second hundred years' ship had twice as many as the first, so it had 2S people.<|LINE_SEP|>The third hundred years' ship had twice as many as the second, so it had 2 * 4S = 8S people.<|LINE_SEP|>All the ships had S + 2S + 8S = 11S = 847 people.<|LINE_SEP|>Thus, the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years had S = 847 / 11 = 77 people on it.<|LINE_SEP|>#### 121<|LINE_SEP|>","Let S be the number of people on the first hundred years' ship.
The second hundred years' ship had twice as many as the first, so it had 2S people.
The third hundred years' ship had twice as many as the second, so it had 2 * 2S = 4S people.
All the ships had S + 2S + 4S = 7S = 847 people.
Thus, the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years had S = 847 / 7 = 121 people on it.
