Question:
Kevin holds the world record for eating the biggest quantity of hot wings in 8 minutes. He can eat 64 wings without stopping. Alan, a boy who loves hot wings, wants to beat Kevin's record.  He is currently able to eat 5 hot wings per minute. How many more wings must he eat per minute to beat Kevin's record?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': "Knowing Kevin's record of eating 70 wings in 8 minutes or 64 / 8 = 8 wings in a minute", 'L2': "Alan must increase his ability to eat 5 wings per minute to 8 - 5 = 3 wings per minute to equal Kevin's world record.", 'L3': 'To beat Kevin, Alan must eat 3+1 = <<3+1=4>>4 hot wings per minute.'}

Question:
A volcano erupts and spews ash into the sky. The ash cloud spreads out in a diameter eighteen times as far as the distance it shot up into the sky. If the ashes erupted three hundred feet into the sky, what was the radius of the ash cloud in feet?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'The ash cloud spread out 300 * 18 = <<300*18=5400>>5400 feet in diameter.', 'L2': 'The radius is half the diameter, so the ash cloud had a radius of 5400 / 2 = <<5400/2=2700>>2700 feet.'}

Question:
Hershel has 10 betta fish and 15 goldfish in a bowl. His friend Bexley brings him 2/5 times as many betta fish and 1/3 times as many goldfish. If Hershel gifts his sister 1/2 of the fish, calculate the total number of fish he has remaining in the bowl.
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'Bexley gives Hershel 2/5*10 = <<2/5*10=4>>4 betta fish.', 'L2': 'The total number of betta fish in the bowl is now 4+10 = <<4+10=14>>14', 'L3': 'He also gives Hershel 1/3*15 = <<1/3*15=5>>5 goldfish', 'L4': 'The total number of goldfish in the bowl is now 15+5 = <<15+5=20>>20', 'L5': 'Counting the betta fish and goldfish, Hershel now has a total of 14 + 20 = <<14+20=34>>34 fish', 'L6': 'When he gives his sister half of the fish, the remaining half is 34/2 = <<34/2=17>>17 fish'}

Question:
Tom goes to a combined undergrad and Ph.D. program.  It takes 3 years to finish the BS and 5 years to finish the Ph.D.  Tom finishes it in 3/4ths the time.  How long does it take for him to finish?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'The program normally takes 3+5=<<3+5=8>>8 years', 'L2': 'So he manages to finish in 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 years'}

Question:
Dakota gets hit by a bus and has to spend 3 days in the hospital. The hospital charges her $900/day for her bed, $250/hour for two specialists to look at her 15 minutes each, and $1800 for the ambulance ride. How much is Dakota's medical bill?
Solution mapping:
{'L1': 'First find the total cost of the hospital bed by multiplying the cost per day by the number of days: $900/day * 3 days = $<<900*3=2700>>2700', 'L2': 'Then figure out how many minutes total the two specialists looked at Dakota: 15 minutes/specialist * 2 specialists = 30 minutes', 'L3': "Then divide the number of minutes by the number of minutes per hour and multiply it by the specialists' hourly rate to find their total charge: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour * $250/hour = $<<30/60*250=125>>125", 'L4': "Finally, add up the cost of the specialists, ambulance and bed to find Dakota's total bill: $2700 + $1800 + $125 = $<<2700+1800+125=4625>>4625"}
