# Calculate the total ounces of water needed for the party
total_water_ounces = 12 * 6

# Calculate the ratio of tea to water from the mom's cup
# mom_tea_ounces_per_cup = 1
# mom_water_ounces_per_cup = 8
# tea_to_water_ratio = mom_tea_ounces_per_cup / mom_water_ounces_per_cup

# Calculate the total ounces of tea needed using the ratio
# total_tea_ounces = total_water_ounces * tea_to_water_ratio
# Simplified calculation:
total_tea_ounces = total_water_ounces / 8
