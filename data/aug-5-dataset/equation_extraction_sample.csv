4966,tier4,"Paul made two bank transfers of $90 and $60 respectively. A service charge of 2% was added to each transaction. If the second transaction was reversed (without the service charge), what is his account balance now if it was $400 before he made any of the transfers?","2% of $90 is (2/100)*$90 = $1.8
2% of $60 is (2/100)*$60 = $1.2
The second transaction was reversed without the service charge so only a total of $90+$1.8+$1.2 = $93 was deducted from his account

2680,tier4,James decides to try and collect rare artifacts in the field.  He spends 6 months researching before going on a 2-year-long expedition for his first find.  The second artifact takes 3 times as long for the research and discovery.  How long did it take him to find both?,"The research took 6/12=.5 years
So it took 2+.5=2.5 years for the first artifact
It takes 2.5*3=7.5 years for the second
So in total it took 2.5+7.5=10 years to find both
FINAL ANSWER: 10","The research took 6/12=0.5 years
So it took 2+0.5=2.5 years for the first artifact
