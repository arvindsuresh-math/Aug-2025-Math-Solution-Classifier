    #: L1
    # Let previous monthly income be p (unknown)

    #: L2
    # Cost of rent and utilities before increase = 40% of p = 2p/5
    # Represented as old_rent_fraction * p

    #: L3
    # New income = p + 600

    #: L4
    # Cost of rent and utilities now = 25% of (p + 600) = (p + 600)/4
    # Represented as new_rent_fraction * (p + increase_amount)

    #: L5
    # Equate old and new rent costs: 2p/5 = (p + 600)/4
    # Using variables: old_rent_fraction * p = new_rent_fraction * (p + increase_amount)

    #: L6
    # Multiply both sides by 20 to clear denominators: 8p = 5p + 3000
    # 20 * old_rent_fraction * p = 20 * new_rent_fraction * (p + increase_amount)

    #: L7
    # Subtract 5p from both sides: 3p = 3000

    #: L8
    # Divide both sides by 3: p = 1000

    # Implementing the algebraic solution:
    # old_rent_fraction * p = new_rent_fraction * (p + increase_amount)
    # old_rent_fraction * p = new_rent_fraction * p + new_rent_fraction * increase_amount
    # old_rent_fraction * p - new_rent_fraction * p = new_rent_fraction * increase_amount
    # p * (old_rent_fraction - new_rent_fraction) = new_rent_fraction * increase_amount
    # p = (new_rent_fraction * increase_amount) / (old_rent_fraction - new_rent_fraction)

    previous_income = (new_rent_fraction * increase_amount) / (old_rent_fraction - new_rent_fraction)
