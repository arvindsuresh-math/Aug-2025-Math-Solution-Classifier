    "flawed_solution": "#### 8\nThe movie that is being replayed 6 times takes 1.5 x 6 = <<6*1.5=9>>9 hours.\nThe advertisements before the start of the movie take 20 x 6 = <<20*6=120>>120 minutes in all.\nOne hundred twenty minutes is equal to 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours.\nThus, the movie theater operates for 6 + 2 = <<6+2=8>>8 hours each day."
