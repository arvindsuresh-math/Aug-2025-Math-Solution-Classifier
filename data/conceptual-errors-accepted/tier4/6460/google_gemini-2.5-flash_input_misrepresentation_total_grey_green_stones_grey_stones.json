    "flawed_solution": "#### 50\nFirst we must determine the percentage of the grey and green stones. We add the two amounts together, finding 40+40=<<40+40=80>>80\nWe then figure out that 40/80=<<40/80=0.5>>0.5, meaning 50 percent of the stones are grey in the second selection.\nThis means that 1-0.5= <<1-0.5=0.5>>0.5, or 50 percent of the stones are green.\nSince there are more green stones than grey stones, and the white and black pile have the same percentage, and there are more white stones than black stones, that means there are 50 percent white stones in the first pile.\nTherefore, to find the number of white stones we multiply 100*0.5= 50 white stones."
