    "flawed_solution": "#### 1\nThe pizza costs $10 and the first topping, pepperoni costs $2 so right now it costs 10=2 = $12\nThe next 2 toppings, sausage and ham, cost $1 each so 2*1 = $<<2*1=2>>2\nThe remaining toppings, olives, mushrooms, bell peppers and pineapple, cost $0.5 each so they cost 4*0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2\nAll total, Jimmy's pizza costs 12+2+2 = $<<12+2+2=16>>16\nThe pizza is sliced into 16 pieces and the pizza costs $16 so each slice costs 16/16= $1 a slice"
