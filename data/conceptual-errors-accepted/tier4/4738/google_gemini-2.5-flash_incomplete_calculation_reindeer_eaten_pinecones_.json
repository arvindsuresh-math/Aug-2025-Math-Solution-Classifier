    "flawed_solution": "#### 1455\nFirst find the number of pinecones eaten by reindeer: 20% * 2000 pinecones = <<0.01*2000=20>>20 pine cones\nThen find the total number of pinecones eaten by squirrels: 20 pine cones * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pine cones\nThen subtract those two amounts to find the number of pinecones left: 2000 pinecones - 20 pine cones - 40 pine cones = <<2000-20-40=1940>>1940 pinecones\nDivide that number by 4 to find the number that are collected for fires: 1940 pinecones / 4 = <<1940/4=485>>485 pine cones\nThen subtract that number from the 1940 pinecones to find the total left on the ground: 1940 pine cones - 485 pinecones = <<1940-485=1455>>1455 pine cones"
