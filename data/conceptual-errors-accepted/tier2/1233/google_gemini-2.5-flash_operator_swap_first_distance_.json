    "flawed_solution": "#### 32\nAt his first speed, Kevin ran 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<10*0.5=20>>20 miles.\nAt his second speed, he ran 20 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<20*0.5=10>>10 miles.\n15 minutes is a quarter of an hour so at his third speed, he ran 8 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = <<8*0.25=2>>2 miles.\nTherefore, Kevin ran a total of 20 miles + 10 miles + 2 miles = <<20+10+2=32>>32 miles."
