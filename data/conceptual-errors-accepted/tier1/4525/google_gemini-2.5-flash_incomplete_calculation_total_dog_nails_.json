    "flawed_solution": "#### 65\nFirst, find the number of dog nails by multiplying the number of dogs by the number of nails on each leg and the number of legs on each dog: 4 dogs * 4 legs per dog nails per leg = <<4*4=16>>16 nails.\nThen do the same for parrots, ignoring the one parrot's extra toe for now: 8 parrots * 2 legs per parrot * 3 nails per leg = <<8*2*3=48>>48 nails\nNow add one to the previous number because one parrot has an extra toe: 48 + 1 = <<48+1=49>>49 nails.\nNow add the number of nails from the parrots and the dog: 49 nails + 16 nails = <<49+16=65>>65 nails."
