    "flawed_solution": "#### 20\nPaul doubles the amount that he ate on the second day, so eats 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 sandwiches.\nFor the third day, he doubles the number of sandwiches he ate on the second day, so eats 2 x 2 x 2 = <<2*2*2=4>>4 sandwiches.\nTo get the total amount of sandwiches he ate over three days it's necessary to add up the amount he ate each day: 2 + 4 + 4 = <<2+4+4=10>>10 sandwiches\nSince he eats 10 sandwiches every 3 days, then in 6 days he would eat 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 sandwiches in total."
