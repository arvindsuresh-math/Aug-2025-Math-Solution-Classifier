    "flawed_solution": "#### 1275\nThe plant supplier earned $50 x 20 = $<<50*20=1000>>1000 for the orchids.\nHe earned $25 x 15 = $<<25*15=375>>375 for the potted Chinese money plants.\nSo, his total earnings was $1000 + $375 = $<<1000+375=1375>>1375.\nThen he paid $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 to his workers.\nHe used a total of $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100 for the worker's pay and new pots.\nHence, he was left with $1375 - $100 = $<<1375-100=1275>>1275 from his earnings."
