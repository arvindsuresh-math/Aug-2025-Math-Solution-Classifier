His water bottle holds 20 ounces which he drinks 3 times a day, 20 x 3 = <<60=60>>60 ounces a typical day.\nOver 7 days, without spilling anything, Remi drinks 60 ounces + 7 days = <<60+7=67>>67 ounces.\nExcept Remi spills 8 + 5 ounces of water during the week = <<8+5=13>>13 ounces of water Remi spills.\nTotal, Remi drinks 67 ounces - 13 ounces of spilled water = <<67-13=54>>54 ounces Remi drank during the week."
