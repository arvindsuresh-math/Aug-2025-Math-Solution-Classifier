    "explanation": "Incomplete calculation. The temperature for one of the years is missing from the sum (only four years have been used), so the correct sum for the past 5 years should be 90+90+90+79+71=420."

    "flawed_solution": "#### 66\nOver the past five years, the sum of the temperatures was 90+90+79+71=<<90+90+79+71=330>>330\nTo find the average temperature you divide the total temperature (330) by 5, so 330/5 = <<330/5=66>>66 degrees"
