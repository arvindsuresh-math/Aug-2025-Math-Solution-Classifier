    "flawed_solution": "#### 8\nAt 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 cents.\nAt 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.\nAdding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 25 + 775 = <<25+775=800>>800 cents.\nSince each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 800 / 100 = <<800/100=8>>8 dollars"
