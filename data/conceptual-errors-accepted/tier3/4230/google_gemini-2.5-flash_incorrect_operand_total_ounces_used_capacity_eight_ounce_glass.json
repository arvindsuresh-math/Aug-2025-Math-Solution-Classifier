    "flawed_solution": "#### 21\nShe has used 32 ounces on 8-ounce glasses because 4 x 8 = 32\nShe has used 30 ounces on the 5-ounce glasses because 6 x 5 = 30\nShe has used 38 ounces in total because 8 + 30 = <<8+30=38>>38\nShe has 84 ounces left because 122 - 38 = <<122-38=84>>84\nShe can fill fifteen four-ounce glasses because 84 / 4 = <<84/4=21>>21"
