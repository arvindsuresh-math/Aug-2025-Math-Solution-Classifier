    "flawed_solution": "#### 3\nFirst find how much sodium the parmesan has in total by multiply the amount of sodium per ounce by the number of oz: 25 mg/oz * 8 oz = <<25*8=200>>200 mg\nThen use the same process to find how much sodium is in the salt: 50 mg/tsp * 2 tsp = <<50*2=100>>100 mg\nThen find the total sodium in the recipe by adding the sodium from the cheese and the salt: 25 mg + 200 mg = <<25+200=225>>225 mg\nThen multiply the total amount of sodium by 1/3 to find how much less sodium James wants: 225 mg * 1/3 = <<225*1/3=75>>75 mg\nThen divide this amount by the amount of sodium per ounce of cheese to find how many fewer ounces of cheese he needs: 75 mg / 25 mg/oz = <<75/25=3>>3 oz"
