    "question": "N/A",
    "flawed_solution": "#### 5\nFrancine has 85 - 5 = <<85-5=80>>80 crayons in total that are in the boxes.\nThus, each box of crayons is filled with 80/5 = <<80/5=16>>16 crayons.\nA total of 5 + 27 = <<5+27=32>>32 crayons need to be placed in the boxes.\nTherefore, they still need 80/16 = <<80/16=5>>5 boxes for the loose crayons."
