# Math Solution Classifier

This application classifies math solutions into three categories:
- **Correct**: Solution is mathematically sound
- **Conceptually Flawed**: Wrong approach or understanding  
- **Computationally Flawed**: Right approach, calculation errors

## Usage

1. Enter a math question
2. Enter the proposed solution
3. Click "Classify Solution"
4. Get instant feedback on the solution quality

Built with Gradio and your custom trained model.
