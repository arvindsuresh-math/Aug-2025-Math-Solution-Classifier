```python
# Calculate the total distance Tim bikes in a week.
# He bikes to and from work for 5 days.
# Distance to work = 20 miles.
# Distance back from work = 20 miles.
# Daily commute distance = 20 + 20 = 40 miles.
# Weekly commute distance = 40 miles/day * 5 days = 200 miles.
# Weekend bike ride distance = 200 miles.
# Total weekly distance = Weekly commute distance + Weekend bike ride distance
total_weekly_distance = (20 * 2 * 5) + 200

# Tim's biking speed is 25 mph.
# Time = Distance / Speed
# Calculate the total time spent biking in a week.
time_spent_biking_hours = total_weekly_distance / 25

# Print the result
print(time_spent_biking_hours)
