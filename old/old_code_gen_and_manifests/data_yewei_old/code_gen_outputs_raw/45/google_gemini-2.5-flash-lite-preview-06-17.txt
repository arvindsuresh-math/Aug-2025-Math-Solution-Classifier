```python
# Calculate the cost of Reese's bags
cost_reeses = 9 * 4

# Calculate the cost of Snickers bags
cost_snickers = 5 * 3

# Calculate the cost of Skittles bags
cost_skittles = 7 * 5

# Calculate the total cost of treats
total_treat_cost = cost_reeses + cost_snickers + cost_skittles

# Calculate the total cost including the pi√±ata
total_cost = 13 + total_treat_cost

# Print the result
