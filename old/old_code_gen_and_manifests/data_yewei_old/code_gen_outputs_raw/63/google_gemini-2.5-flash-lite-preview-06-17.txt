# Calculate the number of situps Shawna was short on Monday
shortfall_monday = 30 - 12

# Calculate the number of situps Shawna was short on Tuesday
shortfall_tuesday = 30 - 19

# Calculate the total number of situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday
# This includes her goal for Wednesday plus the shortfalls from Monday and Tuesday
situps_wednesday = 30 + shortfall_monday + shortfall_tuesday
