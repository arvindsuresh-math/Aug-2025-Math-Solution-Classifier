# Let p be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income.
# The cost of her rent and utilities was 40% of p, which is 0.40 * p.
# Her income was increased by $600, so her new income is p + 600.
# The cost of her rent and utilities now amounts to 25% of her new income, which is 0.25 * (p + 600).
# We can set up an equation since the cost of rent and utilities is the same in both scenarios:
# 0.40 * p = 0.25 * (p + 600)

# Solve for p:
# 0.40p = 0.25p + 0.25 * 600
# 0.40p = 0.25p + 150
# 0.40p - 0.25p = 150
# 0.15p = 150
# p = 150 / 0.15
# p = 1000

def solve_29():
    # Previous monthly income
    p = 1000
    return p
