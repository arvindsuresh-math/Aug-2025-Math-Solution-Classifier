    #: L1
    total_water_ounces = num_people * party_cup_size

    #: L2
    # The ratio is 1 ounce of tea for every 8 ounces of water.
    # So, total_water_ounces / mom_cup_size gives the number of 'mom_cup_size' units,
    # and multiplying by mom_tea_amount gives the total tea needed.
    total_tea_needed = total_water_ounces / mom_cup_size * mom_tea_amount

    answer = total_tea_needed # FINAL ANSWER
