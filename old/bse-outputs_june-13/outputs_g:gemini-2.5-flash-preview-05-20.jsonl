{"original_problem": "Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam.

The problem states that Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty (16 + 20 = 36) and twice as many as Natalie, which implies Natalie picked 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries. However, a subsequent sentence explicitly states that Natalie picked only 15 strawberries. This direct contradiction makes it impossible to determine the true number of strawberries Natalie picked, and therefore the total number of strawberries, rendering the final question unanswerable."}

The problem initially states James uses 'half the pieces' (which would be 250 Legos out of 500), but then a subsequent sentence states he 'ended up using exactly 300 pieces for his castle.' This creates two conflicting values for the number of Legos used, making it impossible to determine the number of leftover pieces and consequently the final count of Legos in the box."}
