    "flawed_solution": "#### 15\nTwice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 7 + 8 = <<7+8=15>>15 meters of fence."
