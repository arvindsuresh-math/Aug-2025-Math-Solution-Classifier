    "flawed_solution": "#### 30\nIf Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons.\nIf Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons.\nTherefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6=<<4+6=10>>10 gallons.\nIn three trips, that means they would move a total of 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 gallons"
