This means he now has 1*2=<<1*2=2>>2 slices of pizza.\nHe cuts each of these 2 slices in half, meaning he now has 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 slices of pizza.\nHe then cuts these in half again, meaning he now has 4*2= <<4*2=8>>8 slices of pizza.\nPhill hands out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, meaning he gave out 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 slices\nHe hands out 1 slice to 3 others, so the total amount of slices handed out are 3+4=7 slices.\n"
