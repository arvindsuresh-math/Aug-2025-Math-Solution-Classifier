    "flawed_solution": "#### 270\nFirst find the amount of tape each 15 in x 30 in box needs on the short sides: 2 sides * 15 inches/side = <<2*15=30>>30 inches\nThen add that to the amount of tape each 15 in x 30 in box needs on the long side to find the total amount needed per box: 30 inches + 30 inches = <<30+30=60>>60 inches\nThen multiply that amount by 5 boxes to find the total amount needed: 60 inches/box * 5 boxes = 300 inches\nThen find the amount of tape each 40 in x 40 in box needs for its three equal length sides: 3 sides * 40 inches/side = <<3*40=120>>120 inches\nThen multiply that amount by 2 boxes to find the total amount needed: 120 inches/box * 2 boxes = 240 inches\nThen add the total amount needed for each box size to find the grand total: 240 inches + 30 inches = <<240+30=270>>270 inches"
