    "flawed_solution": "#### 120\nClaire has 400 - 120 = <<400-120=280>>280 roses in her garden.\nThus, she has 400 - 80 = <<400-80=320>>320 red roses.\nOne-half of the red roses is equal to 1/2 x 320 = <<1/2*320=160>>160.\nTherefore, Claire will earn $0.75 x 160 = $120 if she can sell 1/2 of the total number of red roses."
