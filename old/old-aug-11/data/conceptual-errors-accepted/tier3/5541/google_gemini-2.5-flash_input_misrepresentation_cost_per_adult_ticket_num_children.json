That leaves $76 - $12 = $<<76-12=64>>64 for the movie tickets\nEach child ticket costs $7, so two children's tickets cost $7 per child ticket * 2 child tickets = $<<7*2=14>>14\nTo find the amount spent on adult tickets, subtract the cost of the children's tickets to get $64 - $14 = $<<64-14=50>>50 for adult tickets.\nDivide $50 for adult tickets / 2 adults = $<<50/2=25>>25 per adult ticket."
