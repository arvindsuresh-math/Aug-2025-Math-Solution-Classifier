    "flawed_solution": "#### 1\nFirst, we need to find the average number of apples per person. We start by adding the three totals together, getting 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 apples\nTo finish finding the average number, we perform 60/3= <<60/3=20>>20 apples per person.\nSince Jim has 20 apples, we divide the average of 20 by Jim's total to find 20/20=<<20/20=1>>1 times that Jim's amount can fit into the average."
