    # The problem sets up an equation for the total number of fruits:
    # Green grapes (G) + Red grapes (3G + 7) + Raspberries (G - 5) = Total fruit
    # G + (3G + 7) + (G - 5) = 102

    # Combine constant terms: +7 - 5 = +2
    constant_term = red_grapes_addition - raspberries_subtraction
    # The equation simplifies to: 5G + 2 = 102
    # To solve for G: 5G = 102 - 2 => 5G = 100
