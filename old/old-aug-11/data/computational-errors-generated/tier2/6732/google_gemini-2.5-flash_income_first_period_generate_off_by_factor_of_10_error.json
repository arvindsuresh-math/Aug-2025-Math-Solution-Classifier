  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much money the ex made during the first 3 years by multiplying his annual earnings by the number of years: 3 years * $30000/year = $<<3*30000=9000>>9000/\nThen find how much his raise was by multiplying his salary by the percentage raise: $30000/year * 20% = $<<30000*20*0.01=6000>>6000/year\nThen add the raise to his original salary to find his new salary: $6000/year + $30000/year = $<<6000+30000=36000>>36000/year\nThen find how much he made working at the new salary by multiplying it by the 4 years he worked: 4 years * $36000/year = $<<4*36000=144000>>144000\nAdd his earnings from the three years and the four years to find his total earnings: $144000 + $9000 = $<<144000+9000=153000>>153000\nNow multiply his total earnings by 30% to find how much he was supposed to pay: $153000 * 30% = $<<153000*30*0.01=45900>>45900\nNow subtract the amount he paid from this number to find how much he owes: $45900 - $1200 = $<<45900-1200=44700>>44700\n#### 44700",
