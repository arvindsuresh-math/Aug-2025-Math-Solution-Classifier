  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how much money the ex made during the first 3 years by multiplying his annual earnings by the number of years: 3 years * $30000/year = $<<3*30000=90000>>90000/\nThen find how much his raise was by multiplying his salary by the percentage raise: $30000/year * 20% = $<<30000*20*0.01=6000>>6000/year\nThen add the raise to his original salary to find his new salary: $6000/year + $30000/year = $<<6000+30000=36000>>36000/year\nThen find how much he made working at the new salary by multiplying it by the 4 years he worked: 4 years * $36000/year = $<<4*36000=414000>>414000\nAdd his earnings from the three years and the four years to find his total earnings: $414000 + $90000 = $<<414000+90000=504000>>504000\nNow multiply his total earnings by 30% to find how much he was supposed to pay: $504000 * 30% = $<<504000*30*0.01=151200>>151200\nNow subtract the amount he paid from this number to find how much he owes: $151200 - $1200 = $<<151200-1200=150000>>150000\n#### 150000",
