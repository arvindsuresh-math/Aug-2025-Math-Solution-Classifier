  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many dogs get adopted each month by multiplying the number of dogs by their chance of getting adopted: 30 dogs * 50% = <<30*50*0.01=15>>15 dogs\nThen do the same thing for the cats: 28 cats * 25% = <<28*25*0.01=7>>7 cats\nAnd do the same thing for the lizards: 20 lizards * 20% = <<20*20*0.01=4>>4 lizards\nNow add up the number of each kind of pet to find the initial total number of pets: 30 dogs + 28 cats + 20 lizards = <<30+28+20=87>>87 pets\nNow subtract all the pets that get adopted in one month from the initial number of pets: 87 pets - 15 dogs - 7 cats - 4 lizards = <<87-15-7-4=61>>61 pets\nNow add the extra 13 pets the shelter takes in that month to find the final number of pets: 61 pets + 13 pets = <<61+13=74>>74 pets\n#### 74",
