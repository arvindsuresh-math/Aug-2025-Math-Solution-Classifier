  "flawed_nl_solution": "To find out how much the saleswoman should return to her, we have to find out how much Sara spent in total. She spent 5.5\u00a3 + 6.5\u00a3 = <<5.5+6.5=8>>8\u00a3.\nSo she gives 20\u00a3 and the cashier should keep 8\u00a3. The cashier therefore returns the difference between these two sums: 20\u00a3 - 8\u00a3 = <<20-8=12>>12\u00a3\n#### 12",
