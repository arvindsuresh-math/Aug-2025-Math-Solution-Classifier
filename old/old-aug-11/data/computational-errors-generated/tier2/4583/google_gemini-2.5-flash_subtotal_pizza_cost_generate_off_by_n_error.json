  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ruby was going to order 1 for her son, 1 for her daughter and 1 to share with her husband. So she needed to order 1+1+1 = <<1+1+1=3>>3 pizzas\nEach pizza cost $10 and she was ordering 3 so that comes to 10*3 = $<<10*3=30>>30\nShe needed to order pepperoni, sausage, black olive and mushroom, which came to 4 toppings at $1 each so 4*1 = $<<4*1=4>>4 extra for toppings\nThe pizzas cost $30 and $4 for the toppings so the total costs of the pizzas came to 30+4 = $<<30+4=39>>39\nShe also had to add a $5 tip to her current order total of $39 so 5+39 = $<<5+39=44>>44 for the total order\n#### 44",
