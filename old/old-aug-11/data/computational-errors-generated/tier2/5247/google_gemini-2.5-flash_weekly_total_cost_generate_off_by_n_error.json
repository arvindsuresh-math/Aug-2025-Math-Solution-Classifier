  "flawed_nl_solution": "Monday through Saturday Juanita buys the paper for $0.5 so that's 6*$0.5 = $<<6*0.5=3>>3\nShe spends $2 for Sunday and $3 for the other 6 days so she spends $2 + $3 = $<<2+3=9>>9 for the newspaper weekly\nOver 52 weeks she spends 52*$9 = $<<52*9=468>>468\nJuanita spends $468 on the newspaper for the year and Grants spends $200 a year so Juanita spends $468-$200 = $<<468-200=268>>268 more\n#### 268",
