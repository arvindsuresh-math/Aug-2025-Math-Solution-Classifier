  "flawed_nl_solution": "She burnt 2 dozen, cooked 2 dozen and then another 2 dozen that evening. So she made 2+2+2 =<<2+2+2=5>>5 dozen cupcakes\nEach dozen makes 12 cupcakes, so she made 5*12= <<5*12=60>>60 cupcakes\nShe threw away 2 dozen cupcakes, so 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cupcakes\nShe made 60, threw away 24, ate 5 and then ate another 4 so she had 60-24-5-4 = <<60-24-5-4=27>>27 cupcakes left\nShe sells the 27 cupcakes at $2 each so she earned 27*2 = $<<27*2=54>>54\nShe made 60 cupcakes at a cost of $0.75 each for a total cost of 60*$0.75 = $<<60*0.75=45>>45\nIf she made $54 on the remaining cupcakes and it cost her $45 to make all of the cupcakes then her profit is $54-$45 = $<<54-45=9>>9\n#### 9",
