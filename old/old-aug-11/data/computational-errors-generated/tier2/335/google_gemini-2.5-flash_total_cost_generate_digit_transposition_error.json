  "flawed_nl_solution": "A small knife is twice the amount of the utensils that costs $10 so the knife costs 2*10 = $<<2*10=20>>20\nAll total, each little kit will costs $14 for mitts, $16 for an apron, $10 for utensils and $20 for a knife for a total of 14+16+10+20 = $<<14+16+10+20=60>>60\nEach kit costs $60 and they are currently 25% off so that's a savings of 60*0.25 = $<<60*0.25=15>>15\nThe kits are $60 and they are $15 off so they now cost 60-15 = $<<60-15=45>>45\nShe needs to buy 3 kits and each kit costs $45 so that's 3*45 = $<<3*45=315>>315\n#### 315",
