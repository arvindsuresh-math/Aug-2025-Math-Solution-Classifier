  "flawed_nl_solution": "First calculate the cost of the pens for one student by multiplying the number of pens by the cost per pen: 5 pens * $0.5/pen = $<<5*0.5=2.5>>2.5\nThen calculate the cost of the notebooks for one student by multiplying the number of notebooks by the cost per notebook: 3 notebooks * $1.25/notebook = $<<3*1.25=3.75>>3.75\nThen calculate the cost of the highlighters for one student by multiplying the number of highlighters by the cost per highlighters: 2 highlighters * $0.75/highlighter = $<<2*0.75=1.5>>1.5\nNow add the cost of all the different supplies to find the total cost for one student: $2.5 + $3.75 + $1.5 + $4.25 = $<<2.5+3.75+1.5+4.25=16>>16\nNow multiply the cost per student by the number of students to find the total cost before the discount: 30 students * $16/student = $<<30*16=480>>480\nNow subtract the teacher discount to find the final cost: $480 - $100 = $<<480-100=380>>380\n#### 380",
