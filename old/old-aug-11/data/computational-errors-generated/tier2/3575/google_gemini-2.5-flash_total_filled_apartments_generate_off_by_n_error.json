  "flawed_nl_solution": "Half the floors are full, so there are 12 floors * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 floors that are full.\nSo the full floors contain 6 floors * 10 apartments = <<6*10=60>>60 apartments.\nThe remaining floors are at half-capacity, so there are 12 floors - 6 full floors = <<12-6=6>>6 half-full floors.\nEach of these floors therefore contains 10 apartments * 0.5 = <<10*0.5=5>>5 apartments.\nSo on the half-full floors, there are a total of 6 floors * 5 apartments = <<6*5=30>>30 apartments.\nIn total, there are 30 + 60 = <<30+60=94>>94 filled apartments in the building.\nThis means there are 94 apartments * 4 people per apartment = <<94*4=376>>376 people in the building.\n#### 376",
