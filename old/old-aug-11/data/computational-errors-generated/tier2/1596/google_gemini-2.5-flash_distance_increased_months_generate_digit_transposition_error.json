  "flawed_nl_solution": "Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 kilometers.\nTwo years is 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = <<24*0.5=12>>12 months.\nSo in 12 months Nina does 400 * 12 = <<400*12=4800>>4800 kilometers.\nAnd in the other 12 months, she does 800 * 12 = <<800*12=9060>>9060 kilometers.\nSo in two years, Nina would be able to make 4800 + 9060 = <<4800+9060=13860>>13860 kilometers.\n#### 13860",
