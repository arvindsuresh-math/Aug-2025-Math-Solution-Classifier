  "flawed_nl_solution": "Every second month Nina does twice the regular distance, which means 400 * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 kilometers.\nTwo years is 24 months, so half of this time is 24 * 0.5 = <<24*0.5=21>>21 months.\nSo in 21 months Nina does 400 * 21 = <<400*21=8400>>8400 kilometers.\nAnd in the other 21 months, she does 800 * 21 = <<800*21=16800>>16800 kilometers.\nSo in two years, Nina would be able to make 8400 + 16800 = <<8400+16800=25200>>25200 kilometers.\n#### 25200",
