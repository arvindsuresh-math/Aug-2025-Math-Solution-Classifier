  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bedroom set is $2000 and it's currently 15% off so 2000*0.15 = $<<2000*0.15=300>>300 off\nSo the new price of the set is 2000-300 = $<<2000-300=17000>>17000\nHe signs up for the credit card so that's 10% off so 0.1*17000 = $<<10*0.01*17000=1700>>1700\nNow the set is 17000-1700 = $<<17000-1700=15300>>15300\nHe has a $200 gift card which brings the price to 15300-200 = $15100\n#### 15100",
