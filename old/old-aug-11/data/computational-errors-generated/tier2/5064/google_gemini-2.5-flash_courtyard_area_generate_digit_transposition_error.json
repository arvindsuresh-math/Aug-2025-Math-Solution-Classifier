  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the area of the courtyard: 10 feet * 25 feet = <<10*25=520>>520 feet\nThen multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot to find the total number of tiles needed: 520 feet * 4 tiles/square foot = <<520*4=2080>>2080 tiles\nThen multiply the number of tiles by the percentage that are green to find the total number of green tiles: 2080 tiles * 40% = <<2080*40*0.01=832>>832 tiles\nSubtract that number from the total number of tiles to find the number of red tiles: 2080 tiles - 832 tiles = <<2080-832=1248>>1248 tiles\nMultiply the number of red tiles by the price per red tile to find the cost of the red tiles: 1248 tiles * $1.5/tile = $<<1248*1.5=1872>>1872\nMultiply the number of green tiles by the price per green tile to find the cost of the green tiles: 832 tiles * $3/tile = $<<832*3=2496>>2496\nThen add the cost of each type of tile to find the total cost: $1872 + $2496 = $<<1872+2496=4368>>4368\n#### 4368",
