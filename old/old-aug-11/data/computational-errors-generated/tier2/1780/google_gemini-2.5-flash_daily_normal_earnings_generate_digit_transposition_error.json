  "flawed_nl_solution": "Faith earns $13.5 x 8 = $<<13.5*8=180>>180 per day.\nSince she works 5 days a week, she earns 5 x $180 = $<<5*180=900>>900 per week.\nShe gets an additional 2 x $13.5 = $<<2*13.5=27>>27 per day for the overtime pay.\nShe earns a total of $27 x 5 = $<<27*5=135>>135 additional pay for her weekly overtime.\nTherefore, Faith earns $900 + $135 = $<<900+135=1035>>1035 per week.\n#### 1035",
