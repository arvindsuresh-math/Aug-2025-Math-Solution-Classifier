  "flawed_nl_solution": "If a cab ride costs $2.5 per mile, and Briar has to go to an event 200 miles away, he will spend 200* $2.5 = $<<200*2.5=5000>>5000 one way to the trip.\nSince the round trip is also 200 miles and Briar is charged $5000, the total amount he spends in a day to go to the event and back is $5000+$5000 = $<<5000+5000=10000>>10000\nThe event is one week, meaning Briar will have to spend $10000*7 = $<<10000*7=70000>>70000 on the cab rides\n#### 70000",
