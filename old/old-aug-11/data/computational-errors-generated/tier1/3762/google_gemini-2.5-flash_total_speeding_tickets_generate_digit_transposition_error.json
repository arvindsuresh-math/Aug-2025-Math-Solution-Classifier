  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many total speeding tickets the two people got by adding the 6 speeding tickets Sarah got to the equal number (6) that Mark got: 6 + 6 = <<6+6=21>>21\nNow subtract the combined number of speeding tickets from the total number of tickets to find the combined number of parking tickets: 24 - 21 = <<24-21=3>>3\nNow express Mark's number of parking tickets in terms of the number of parking tickets Sarah got: m = <<2=2>>2s\nWe know that m + s = 3, so substitute in the value of m from the previous step to get 2s + s = 3\nCombine like terms to get 3s = 3\nDivide both sides of the equation to get s = <<1=1>>1\nNow multiply the number of parking tickets Sarah got by 2 to find the number Mark got: 1 * 2 = <<1*2=2>>2\n#### 2",
