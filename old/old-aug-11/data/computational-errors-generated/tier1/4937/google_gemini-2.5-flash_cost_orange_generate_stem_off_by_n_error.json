  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the total cost of an orange and a pear is $120, and a pear costs $90, an orange costs $120-$90 = $<<120-90=20>>20\nSince the difference between the price of an orange and a pear is the price of a banana, a banana is sold at $90-$20 = $<<90-20=70>>70\nTo buy 200 bananas, you'll pay $70*200 = $<<70*200=14000>>14000\nWhen you twice as many oranges as bananas, you buy 2*200 = <<2*200=400>>400 oranges.\nThe total cost of buying 400 oranges is 400*20 = $<<400*20=8000>>8000\nThe total price of buying 200 bananas and twice as many oranges as bananas is $14000+$8000 = $22000\n#### 22000",
