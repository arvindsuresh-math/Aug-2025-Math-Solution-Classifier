  "flawed_nl_solution": "First convert the length of the mural to inches: 15 feet * 12 inches/foot = <<15*12=810>>810 inches\nThen convert the height of the mural to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = <<10*12=120>>120 inches\nThen multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural: 810 inches * 120 inches = <<810*120=97200>>97200 square inches. Since each tile is 1 square inch, this is also the number of tiles she needs.\n#### 97200",
