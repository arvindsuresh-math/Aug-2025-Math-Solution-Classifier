  "flawed_nl_solution": "One year is 12 months, so during the first year, Kate spent $5/month * 12 months/year = $<<5*12=60>>60/year on the tickets.\nAfter that, she went to the museum for 3 years - 1 year = <<3-1=2>>2 more years.\nDuring this time, she visited the museum 2 years * 4 visits/year = <<2*4=8>>8 visits.\nShe had to pay the higher price of $7, so she spent $7/visit * 8 visits = $<<7*8=65>>65 in two last years.\nIn total Kate paid $65 + $60 = $<<65+60=125>>125 during 3 years.\n#### 125",
