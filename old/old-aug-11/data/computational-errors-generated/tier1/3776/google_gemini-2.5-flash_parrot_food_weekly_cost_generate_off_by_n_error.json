  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the rabbit food costs $12 a week, then the parrot food costs $30 - $12 = $17 a week.\nJulia has the parrot for 3 weeks, so she spent 3 weeks * $17/week = $<<3*17=51>>51 on her.\nThe rabbit is her only for 5 weeks, so she spent 5 weeks * $12/week = $<<5*12=60>>60 on him.\nIn total, Julia spent $51 + $60 = $<<51+60=111>>111 on food for her animals.\n#### 111",
