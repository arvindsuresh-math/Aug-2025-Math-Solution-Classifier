  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jean's dress was $10 less than Pauline's $30 dress, meaning it was 30-10= <<30-10=10>>10 dollars.\nIda's dress was $30 more than Jean's $10 dress, meaning it was 30+10=<<30+10=40>>40 dollars.\nPatty's dress was $10 more than Ida's $40 dress, meaning it was 40+10=<<40+10=50>>50 dollars.\nTherefore, all four women together spent 50+40+10+30=<<50+40+10+30=130>>130 dollars.\n#### 130",
