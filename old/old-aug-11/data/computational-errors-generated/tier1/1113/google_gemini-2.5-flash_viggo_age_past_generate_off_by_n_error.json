  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice Viggo's younger brother's age when his brother was 2 is 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 years.\nIf Viggo's age was 10 more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2, Viggo was 10+4 = 19 years old.\nViggo is 19 years - 2 years = <<19-2=17>>17 years older than his brother\nSince Viggo's brother is currently 10 and Vigo is 17 years older, he's currently 10 + 17 = <<10+17=27>>27 years old\nTheir combined age is 27 years + 10 years = <<27+10=37>>37 years\n#### 37",
