  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the number of weeks Casey stays: 3 months * 4 weeks/month = <<3*4=21>>21 weeks\nThen multiply that number by the weekly rate to find how much she would pay weekly: 21 weeks * $280/week = $<<21*280=5880>>5880\nThen multiply the number of months she stays by the monthly rate to find how much she pays monthly: $1000/month * 3 months = $<<1000*3=3000>>3000\nThen subtract that number from the total amount she pays if she pays weekly to find her savings: $5880 - $3000 = $<<5880-3000=2880>>2880\n#### 2880",
