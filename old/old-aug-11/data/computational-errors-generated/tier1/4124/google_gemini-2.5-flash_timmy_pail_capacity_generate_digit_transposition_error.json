  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons.\nIf Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=21>>21 gallons.\nTherefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+21=<<4+6+21=31>>31 gallons.\nIn three trips, that means they would move a total of 31*3=<<31*3=93>>93 gallons\n#### 93",
