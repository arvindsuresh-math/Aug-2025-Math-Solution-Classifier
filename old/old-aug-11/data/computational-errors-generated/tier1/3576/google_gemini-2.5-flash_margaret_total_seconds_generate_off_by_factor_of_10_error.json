  "flawed_nl_solution": "Margaret finished all of her laps in 10 minutes * 60 seconds = <<10*60=6000>>6000 seconds.\nBilly's first 5 laps took 2 minutes * 60 seconds = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds.\nHis next 3 laps took 4 minutes * 60 seconds = <<4*60=240>>240 seconds.\nHis ninth lap took 1 minute * 60 seconds = <<1*60=60>>60 seconds.\nSo his first 9 laps took 120 + 240 + 60 = <<120+240+60=420>>420 seconds.\nBilly finished swimming his laps before Margaret so all of his laps took a total of 6000 - 30 = <<6000-30=5970>>5970 seconds.\nThis means that it took 5970 seconds in total swimming time - 420 seconds in time spent swimming the first 9 laps = 5550 seconds for Billy to swim his final lap.\n#### 5550",
