  "flawed_nl_solution": "Margaret finished all of her laps in 10 minutes * 60 seconds = <<10*60=600>>600 seconds.\nBilly's first 5 laps took 2 minutes * 60 seconds = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds.\nHis next 3 laps took 4 minutes * 60 seconds = <<4*60=204>>204 seconds.\nHis ninth lap took 1 minute * 60 seconds = <<1*60=60>>60 seconds.\nSo his first 9 laps took 120 + 204 + 60 = <<120+204+60=384>>384 seconds.\nBilly finished swimming his laps before Margaret so all of his laps took a total of 600 - 30 = <<600-30=570>>570 seconds.\nThis means that it took 570 seconds in total swimming time - 384 seconds in time spent swimming the first 9 laps = 186 seconds for Billy to swim his final lap.\n#### 186",
