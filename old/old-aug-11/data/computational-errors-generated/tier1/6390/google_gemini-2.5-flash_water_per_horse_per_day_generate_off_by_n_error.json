  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total horse he owns is 5+3= <<5+3=8>>8.\nThe total liters of water each horse consumes is 5 + 2= <<5+2=2>>2.\nSo, the total water all the horses consume every day is 2 x 8 = <<2*8=16>>16.\nAnd the total of liters of water they consume every week is 16 x 7 = <<16*7=112>>112.\nTherefore, the total liters of water they consume for the entire month is 112 x 4= <<112*4=448>>448.\n#### 448",
