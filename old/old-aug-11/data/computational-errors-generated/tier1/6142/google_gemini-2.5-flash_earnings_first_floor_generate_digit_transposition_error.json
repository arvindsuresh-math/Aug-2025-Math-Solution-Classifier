  "flawed_nl_solution": "Krystiana earns $15 x 3 = $<<15*3=54>>54 for the rooms on the first floor every month.\nShe earns $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60 for the rooms on the second floor every month.\nAnd the cost for each room on the third floor is $15 x 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.\nSo, the total amount she earns for the rooms on the third floor is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60 every month.\nTherefore, the total amount she earns from the apartment building is $60 + $60 + $54 = $<<60+60+54=174>>174.\n#### 174",
