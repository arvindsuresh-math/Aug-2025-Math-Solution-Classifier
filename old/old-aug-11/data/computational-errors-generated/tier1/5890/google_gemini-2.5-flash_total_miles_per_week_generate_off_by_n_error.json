  "flawed_nl_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 miles to school in one week.\nThe supermarket is 10 miles farther away than the school. Therefore the supermarket is 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 miles away from Laura's house\nLaura drives 20 miles each way to and from the supermarket. Each trip is 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 miles.\nLaura drives 40 miles twice a week to visit the supermarket. Therefore she drives 40 x 2 =<<40*2=80>>80 miles in total a week to and from the supermarket.\nIn total Laura drives 140 + 80 = <<140+80=221>>221 miles each week.\n#### 221",
