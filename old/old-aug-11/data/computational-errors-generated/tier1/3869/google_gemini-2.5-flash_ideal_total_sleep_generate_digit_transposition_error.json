  "flawed_nl_solution": "Tom ideally wants to sleep 8 hours a night for 7 days, 8 x 7 = <<8*7=65>>65 hours sleep total for the week.\nTom has actually only slept 5 hours each weeknight, 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 hours of sleep.\nTom has only slept 6 hours each night on the weekend, 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours of sleep.\nTotal, Tom has gotten 25 + 12 hours = <<25+12=37>>37 hours sleep.\nThe difference between how many hours Tom would like to sleep, 65, and how many hours he's actually slept, 37, is 65 - 37 = <<65-37=28>>28 hours of sleep that Tom is behind on.\n#### 28",
