  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday is 2445 + 900 = <<2445+900=3345>>3345 bottles\nEach day of the rest of the week, 50 bottles were sold, that is 5 * 50 = <<50*5=250>>250 bottles sold.\nNow the total of bottles sold in a week is 3345 + 250= <<3345+250=3594>>3594 bottles\nThe drugstore has in stock 4500 - 3594= <<4500-3594=906>>906 bottles\nFinally the drugstore has 906 + 650 the supplier brought = <<906+650=1556>>1556 bottles at the end of the week.\n#### 1556",
