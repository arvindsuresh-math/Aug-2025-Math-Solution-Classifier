  "flawed_nl_solution": "On days one, two, and three he sold 5 cars each day so, 5 cars + 5 cars + 5 cars = <<5+5+5=15>>15 cars that he sold on those days.\nOn days 4,5,6 and 7 he sold 3 cars each day so, 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars = <<3+3+3+3=16>>16 cars that he sold on those days.\nNow we combine the cars he has already sold, which is 15 cars, and 16 cars, so 15 cars + 16 cars = <<15+16=31>>31 cars are sold in total.\nIf he needs to sell 50 cars and has already sold 31 cars then 50 cars - 31 cars = <<50-31=19>>19 cars left to sell to meet his quota.\n#### 19",
