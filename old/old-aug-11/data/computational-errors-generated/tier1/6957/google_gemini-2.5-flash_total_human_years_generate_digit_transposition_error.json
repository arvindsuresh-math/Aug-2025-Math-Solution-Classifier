  "flawed_nl_solution": "If your dog is 10 years old then in his first year of life he lived 1*15 = 15 human years\nIn his second year of life, he lived 1*9 = <<1*9=9>>9 human years\nWe need to calculate his remaining years or 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 years of dog life into human years\nIf 1 year of dog life after the 2 years equates to 5 human years, then 8 years of dog life equals 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 human years\nIn total, your dog has lived 15 + 9 + 40 = <<15+9+40=46>>46 human years\n#### 46",
