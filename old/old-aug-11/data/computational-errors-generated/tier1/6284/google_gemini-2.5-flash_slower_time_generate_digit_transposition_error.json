  "flawed_nl_solution": "Lola climbs 20 stories in 20 stories x 10 seconds/story = <<20*10=200>>200 seconds\nTara can go up the elevator in 8 seconds/story x 20 stories = <<8*20=160>>160 seconds without the stops at each floor.\nThe elevator stops for 3 seconds on each floor for a total of 20 stories x 3 seconds/story = <<20*3=60>>60 seconds.\nIn total it takes Tara 160 seconds + 60 seconds = <<160+60=220>>220 seconds to reach the top floor.\nBecause 200 < 220 Lola wins.\n#### 202",
