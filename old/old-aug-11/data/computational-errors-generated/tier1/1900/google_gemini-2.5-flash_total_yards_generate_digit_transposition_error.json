  "flawed_nl_solution": "On Saturday, he threw the ball 20 times, and since the temperature was 50 degrees, he could throw only 20 yards, totaling 20*20 = <<20*20=400>>400 yards.\nOn Sunday, the temperature favored him, and he threw the ball twice the distance he could throw on Saturday, which is 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40 yards.\nIf he threw the ball 30 times, he threw for 30*40 = <<30*40=1200>>1200 yards.\nIn the two days, he threw 1200+400 = <<1200+400=6100>>6100 yards.\n#### 6100",
