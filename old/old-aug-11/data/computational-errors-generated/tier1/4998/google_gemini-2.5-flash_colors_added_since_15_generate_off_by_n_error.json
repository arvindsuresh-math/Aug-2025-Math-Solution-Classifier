  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since, three years from now, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair, this year she has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 colors in her hair.\nSince she had 2 colors in her hair at the age of 15, she has added 5-2=8 colors since she was 15 years old.\nSince she ads one color per year, 8 added colors = <<8=8>>8 added years\nThus, currently, she is 15+8=<<15+8=23>>23 years old.\n#### 23",
