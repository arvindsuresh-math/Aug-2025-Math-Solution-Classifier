  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=45>>45 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 45 mph = $<<2*45=90>>90\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $90 + $50 = $<<90+50=140>>140\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $140 * 2 = $<<140*2=280>>280\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=420>>420\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $420 + $300 + $280 = $<<420+300+280=1000>>1000\n#### 1000",
