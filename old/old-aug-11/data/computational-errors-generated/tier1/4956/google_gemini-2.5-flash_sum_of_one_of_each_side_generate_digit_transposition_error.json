  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the area of each long side by multiplying the length and width: 8 inches * 6 inches = <<8*6=48>>48 square inches\nThen do the same thing for each short side: 5 inches * 6 inches = <<5*6=30>>30 square inches\nNow add the area of one long side, one short side, and one top/bottom together: 48 square inches + 30 square inches + 40 square inches = <<48+30+40=181>>181 square inches\nNow double that quantity because there are two of each kind of side: 181 square inches * 2 = <<181*2=362>>362 square inches\n#### 362",
