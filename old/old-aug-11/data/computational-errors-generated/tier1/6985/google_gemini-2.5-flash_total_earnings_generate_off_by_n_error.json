  "flawed_nl_solution": "Andy works 8 hours, so he earns a wage of 8 hours * $9 per hour = $<<8*9=72>>72 just for working there.\nDuring that time, he restrings 7 racquets, so he earns 7 racquets * $15 per racquet = $<<7*15=105>>105 from stringing.\nHe also changed the grommets in 2 of those racquets, so he earned 2 grommet jobs * $10 per grommet job = $<<2*10=20>>20 from changing grommets.\nAnd he stenciled 5 racquets, so he earned 5 stencil jobs * $1 per stencil job = $<<5*1=5>>5 for stenciling.\nIn total, Andy earned $72 + $105 + $20 + 5 = $<<72+105+20+5=200>>200 for the day.\n#### 200",
