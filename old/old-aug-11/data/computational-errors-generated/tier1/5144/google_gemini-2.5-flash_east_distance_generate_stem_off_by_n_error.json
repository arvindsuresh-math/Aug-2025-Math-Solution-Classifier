  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the distance he took traveling to the East is 20 miles more than the distance he took to travel to the south, he took 40+20 = 50 miles traveling to the East.\nJohny's total distance traveling to the south and then to the East is 50+40 = <<50+40=90>>90 miles.\nThe journey to the North was 2*50 = <<2*50=100>>100, twice the distance he took traveling to the East.\nThe whole journey took 90+100 = <<90+100=190>>190 miles.\n#### 190",
