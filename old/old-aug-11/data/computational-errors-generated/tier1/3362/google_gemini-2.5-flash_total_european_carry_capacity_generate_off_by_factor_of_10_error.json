  "flawed_nl_solution": "Thus, the number of European swallows x=<<30=30>>30.\nAnd the number of American swallows is 90-30=<<90-30=60>>60.\nA European swallow can carry twice what an American swallow can carry, or 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 pounds.\n30 European swallows can carry a maximum of 30*10=<<30*10=3000>>3000 pounds.\n60 American swallows can carry a maximum of 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 pounds.\nThus, a flock of 90 birds, with 30 European and 60 American swallows, can carry 3000+300=3300 pounds\n#### 3300",
