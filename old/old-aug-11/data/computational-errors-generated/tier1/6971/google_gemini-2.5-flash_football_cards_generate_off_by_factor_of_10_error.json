  "flawed_nl_solution": "If there are 200 hockey cards in the bag and 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards, there are 4*200 = <<200*4=8000>>8000 football cards.\nThe total number of football and hockey cards in the bag is 8000+200 = <<8000+200=8200>>8200 cards.\nThe bag contains 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards, meaning there are 8000-50 = 7950 baseball cards.\nAltogether, there are 7950+8200 = <<7950+8200=16150>>16150 cards.\n#### 16150",
