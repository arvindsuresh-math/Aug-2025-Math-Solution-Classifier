  "flawed_nl_solution": "On the eastern part of the campsite, Mr Manuel counted 2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 tents\nThe total number of tents in the eastern and the northern part of the campgrounds is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300\nThere are four times as many tents as the northernmost part in the central part of the campsite, which means there are 4*100 = <<4*100=40>>40 tents in the central part of the camp.\nThe total number of tents in the three parts of the campsite is 40+300 = <<40+300=340>>340\nIf you add the number of tents Mr. Manuel counted at the southern part of the campsite, you get 340+200 = <<340+200=540>>540 tents on the whole campsite\n#### 540",
