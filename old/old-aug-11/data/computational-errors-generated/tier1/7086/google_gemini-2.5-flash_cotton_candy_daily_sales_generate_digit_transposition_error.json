  "flawed_nl_solution": "The booth made $50 x 3 = $<<50*3=105>>105 selling cotton candy each day.\nIn a day, the booth made a total of $105 + $50 = $<<105+50=155>>155.\nIn 5 days, they made a total of $155 x 5 = $<<155*5=775>>775.\nThe booth has to pay a total of $30 + $75 = $<<30+75=105>>105.\nThus, the booth earned $775 - $105 = $<<775-105=670>>670.\n#### 670",
