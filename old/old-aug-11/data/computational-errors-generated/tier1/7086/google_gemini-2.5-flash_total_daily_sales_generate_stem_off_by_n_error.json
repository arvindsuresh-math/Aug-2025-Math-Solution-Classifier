  "flawed_nl_solution": "The booth made $50 x 3 = $<<50*3=150>>150 selling cotton candy each day.\nIn a day, the booth made a total of $150 + $50 = $<<150+50=170>>170.\nIn 5 days, they made a total of $170 x 5 = $<<170*5=850>>850.\nThe booth has to pay a total of $30 + $75 = $<<30+75=105>>105.\nThus, the booth earned $850 - $105 = $<<850-105=745>>745.\n#### 745",
