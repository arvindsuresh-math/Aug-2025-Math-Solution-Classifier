  "flawed_nl_solution": "Machine A can put caps on 12 x 10 = <<12*10=120>>120 bottles in 10 minutes.\nMachine B can put caps on 12 - 2 = <<12-2=10>>10 bottles in 1 minute.\nSo in 10 minutes, machine B can put caps on 10 x 10 = <<10*10=100>>100 bottles.\nMachine c can put caps on 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 bottles in 1 minute.\nSo in 10 minutes, machine C can put caps on 15 x 10 = <<15*10=105>>105 bottles.\nTherefore, the three machines can put caps on 120 + 100 + 105 = <<120+100+105=325>>325 bottles in 10 minutes.\n#### 325",
