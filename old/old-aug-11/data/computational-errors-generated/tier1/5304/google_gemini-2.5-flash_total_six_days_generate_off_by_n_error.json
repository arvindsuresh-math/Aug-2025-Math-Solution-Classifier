  "flawed_nl_solution": "Gumball's total water intake on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday is 9 x 3 = <<9*3=27>>27 liters.\nAnd his total water intake on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday is 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 liters.\nSo his total water intake for 6 days is 24 + 27 = <<24+27=54>>54 liters.\nTherefore Gumball's water intake on Wednesday is 60 - 54 = <<60-54=6>>6 liters.\n#### 6",
