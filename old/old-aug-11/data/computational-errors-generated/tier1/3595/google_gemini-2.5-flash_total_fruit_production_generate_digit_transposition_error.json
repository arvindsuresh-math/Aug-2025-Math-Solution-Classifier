  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the total production of mangoes was 400, then orange production was 400+200 = <<400+200=600>>600 kg of oranges.\nSince apple production was twice the total production of mangoes, Mr. Sergio had 2*400 = <<2*400=800>>800 kg of apples.\nThe total quantity of fruits produced at Mr. Sergio's farm is 800 kg of apples+600 kg of oranges + 400 kg of mangoes = <<800+600+400=8100>>8100 kg of fruits.\nIf Mr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg, his total income from the sales is 8100*$50 = $<<8100*50=405000>>405000.\n#### 405000",
