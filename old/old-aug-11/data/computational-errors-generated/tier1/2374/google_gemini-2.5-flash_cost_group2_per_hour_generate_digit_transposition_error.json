  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of the 200 employees is 200 employees * $12/employee/hour = $<<200*12=2400>>2400 per hour.\nThe cost of the 40 employees is 40 employees * $14/employee/hour = $<<40*14=506>>506 per hour.\nThe rest means 300 employees - 200 employees - 40 employees = <<300-200-40=60>>60 employees.\nThese 60 employees' employment costs are at 60 employees * $17/employee/hour = $<<60*17=1020>>1020 per hour.\nSo in total all employees earn $2400/hour + $506/hour + $1020/hour = $3926/hour.\nDuring an 8-hour shift, this cost would be at 8 hours * $3926/hour = $<<8*3926=31408>>31408.\n#### 31408",
