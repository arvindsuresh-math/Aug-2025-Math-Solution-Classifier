  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find Devin's new height by adding his growth to the original height: 65 inches + 3 inches = <<65+3=69>>69 inches\nThen subtract 66 inches from Devin's height to find how many extra inches of height he has: 69 inches - 66 inches = <<69-66=3>>3 inches\nThen multiply the number of extra inches by the percentage increase per inch to find the total percentage increase in his chances: 3 inches * 10%/inch = 30%\nThen add the percentage increase to the base percentage to find Devin's overall chance of making the basketball team: 10% + 30% = 40%\n#### 40",
