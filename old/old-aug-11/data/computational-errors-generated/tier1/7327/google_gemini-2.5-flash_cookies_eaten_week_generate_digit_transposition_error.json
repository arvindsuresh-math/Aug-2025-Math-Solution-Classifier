  "flawed_nl_solution": "First we find how many cookies Betty will eat in a week by multiplying her daily amount by 7, meaning 7*3=<<12=12>>12 cookies eaten in a week.\nWe repeat this for the brownies, finding she eats 7*1=<<7*1=7>>7 brownies in a week.\nWe subtract the 12 cookies from the original amount of 60, finding 60-12= <<60-12=48>>48 cookies remaining.\nWe repeat this step for the brownies, finding 10-7= <<10-7=3>>3 brownies remaining.\nIn the end, therefore, Betty has 48-3= <<48-3=45>>45 more cookies than brownies.\n#### 45",
