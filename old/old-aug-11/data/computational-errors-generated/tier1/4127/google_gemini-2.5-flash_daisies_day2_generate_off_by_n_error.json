  "flawed_nl_solution": "The flower shop sold 45 + 20 = <<45+20=70>>70 daisies on the second day.\nTwice the number of flowers on the second day is 70 x 2 = <<70*2=140>>140.\nSo, the flower shop sold 140 - 10 = <<140-10=130>>130 daisies on the third day.\nThe total daisies sold for 3 days was 45 + 70 + 130 = <<45+70+130=245>>245.\nTherefore, 350 - 245 = <<350-245=105>>105 daisies were sold on the 4th day.\n#### 105",
