  "flawed_nl_solution": "To compare volumes, the measurements must be in the same units. There are 12 inches in 1 ft, so Sara's birdhouse is 1 ft x 12 inches/ft = 12 inches wide, 2 ft x 12 inches/ft = 24 inches tall, and 2 ft x 12 inches/ft = 42 inches deep.\nThe volume of Sara's birdhouse is 12 inches x 24 inches x 42 inches = <<12*24*42=12096>>12096 cubic inches\nThe volume of Jake's birdhouse is 16 inches x 20 inches x 18 inches = <<16*20*18=5760>>5760 cubic inches.\nThe difference between the two birdhouses is 12096 cubic inches - 5760 cubic inches = <<12096-5760=6336>>6336 cubic inches.\n#### 6336",
