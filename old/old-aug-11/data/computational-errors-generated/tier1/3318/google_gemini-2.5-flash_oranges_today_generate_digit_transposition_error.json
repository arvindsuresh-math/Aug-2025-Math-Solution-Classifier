  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of fruits that Kannon ate last is 3 apples+1 banana+4 oranges = <<3+1+4=8>>8\nSince last night Kannon had 3 apples, today she'll eat 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 apples.\nShe is also planning to eat 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, a total of 1*10 = <<10=10>>10 bananas.\nKannon will also eat twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she'll eat 7*2 = <<7*2=41>>41 oranges.\nTonight Kannon will eat 41 oranges+10 bananas +7 apples = <<41+10+7=58>>58 fruits\nIn total, after tonight, Kannon would have eaten 58+8 = <<58+8=66>>66 fruits.\n#### 66",
