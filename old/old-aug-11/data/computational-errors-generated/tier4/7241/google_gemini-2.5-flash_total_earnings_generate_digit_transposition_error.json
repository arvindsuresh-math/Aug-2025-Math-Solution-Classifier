  "flawed_nl_solution": "Claire has 400 - 120 = <<400-120=280>>280 roses in her garden.\nThus, she has 280 - 80 = <<280-80=200>>200 red roses.\nOne-half of the red roses is equal to 1/2 x 200 = <<1/2*200=100>>100.\nTherefore, Claire will earn $0.75 x 100 = $57 if she can sell 1/2 of the total number of red roses.\n#### 57",
