  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since it is 50% taller, then 180 inches is 100% + 50% = 150% of its height then.\nSo each 1% is equal to 180/150 = <<180/150=12>>12 inches.\nSo, its height then was 12 x 100% = 1200 inches.\nSince 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 1200 inches is equal to 1200/12 = <<1200/12=100>>100 feet.\n#### 100",
