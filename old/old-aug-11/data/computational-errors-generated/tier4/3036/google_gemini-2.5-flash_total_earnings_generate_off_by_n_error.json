  "flawed_nl_solution": "Lovely will sell 10 x 2/5 = <<10*2/5=4>>4 books for $2.50 each.\nShe will sell 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 books for $2 each.\nHer earnings for the 4 books at $2.5 will be $2.5 x 4 = $<<2.5*4=10>>10.\nHer earnings for the 6 books for $2 each will be $2 x 6 = $<<2*6=12>>12.\nThus, Lovely's total earning if all 10 books are sold is $10 + $12 = $20.\n#### 20",
