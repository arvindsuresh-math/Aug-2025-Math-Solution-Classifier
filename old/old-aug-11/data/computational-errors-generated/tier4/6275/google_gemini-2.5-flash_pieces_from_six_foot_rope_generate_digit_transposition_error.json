  "flawed_nl_solution": "She needs 60 inches of rope because 10 x 6 equals <<10*6=60>>60\nThe six-foot length of rope is 72 inches long because 6 x 12 = <<6*12=72>>72\nThe six-foot length of rope would give her 21 pieces because 72 / 6 = <<72/6=21>>21\nShe would need 5 of the 1-foot ropes because 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5\nIf she bought one-foot ropes it would cost $6.25 because 5 x 1.25 = 6.25\nThe cheapest rope to buy is the 6-foot rope because 5 < 6.25\n#### 5",
