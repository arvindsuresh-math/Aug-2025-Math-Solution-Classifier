  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each dog consumes 250 grams x 2 = <<250*2=5000>>5000 grams of dog food each day.\nSo, 4 dogs consume 5000 grams x 4 = <<5000*4=20000>>20000 grams of dog food each day.\nSince there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, then the 4 dogs can consume 20000/1000 = <<20000/1000=20>>20 kilograms of dog food each day.\nAunt Gemma bought a total of 50 kilograms x 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 kilograms of dog food.\nHence, it will last 100 kilograms/20 kilograms = <<100/20=5>>5 days.\n#### 5",
