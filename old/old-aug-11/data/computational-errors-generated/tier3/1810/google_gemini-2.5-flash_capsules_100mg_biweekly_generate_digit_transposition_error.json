  "flawed_nl_solution": "Heisenberg sells a total of $80/5= <<80/5=16>>16 capsules of 100 mg amoxicillin every week.\nSo, the total number of 100 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 16 x 2= <<16*2=23>>23.\nAnd he sells $60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 capsules of 500 mg amoxicillin every week.\nSo, the total number of 500 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 30 x 2= 60.\nTherefore, the total number of capsules he sells every 2 weeks is 60 + 23 = <<60+23=83>>83.\n#### 83",
