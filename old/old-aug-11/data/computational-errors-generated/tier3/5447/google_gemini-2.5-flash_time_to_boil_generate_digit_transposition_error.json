  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many degrees the temperature of the water needs to increase: 212 degrees - 41 degrees = <<212-41=171>>171 degrees\nThen divide that amount by the number of degrees the water temperature increases each minute to find how long it takes the water to boil: 171 degrees / 3 degrees/minute = <<171/3=75>>75 minutes\nNow figure out how long it takes to mix the pasta and make salad by dividing the pasta cook time by 3: 12 minutes / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 minutes\nNow add the boiling time, cook time, and mixing time to find the total time it takes to make dinner: 75 minutes + 4 minutes + 12 minutes = <<75+4+12=91>>91 minutes\n#### 91",
