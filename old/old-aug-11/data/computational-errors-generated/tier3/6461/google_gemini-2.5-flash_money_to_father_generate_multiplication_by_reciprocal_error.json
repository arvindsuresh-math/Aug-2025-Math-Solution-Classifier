  "flawed_nl_solution": "John's mother received 3/8 x $200 = $75<<3/8*200=75>>75.\nHis father got 3/10 x $200 = $2000/3<<3/10*200=2000/3>>2000/3.\nThus, John gave a total of $75 + $2000/3 = $2225/3<<75+2000/3=2225/3>>2225/3.\nTherefore, John had $200 - $2225/3 = $-1625/3<<200-2225/3=-1625/3>>-1625/3 left.\n#### -1625/3",
