  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ivan has 50 x 10 = <<50*10=5000>>5000 cents from the 50 dimes in his one piggy bank.\nSo, he has a total of 100 + 5000 = <<100+5000=5100>>5100 cents in one of his piggy banks.\nSince 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, then Ivan has 5100/100 = 51 dollars from one of his piggy banks.\nTherefore, Ivan has a total of $51 x 2 piggy banks = $<<51*2=102>>102 from his two piggy banks.\n#### 102",
