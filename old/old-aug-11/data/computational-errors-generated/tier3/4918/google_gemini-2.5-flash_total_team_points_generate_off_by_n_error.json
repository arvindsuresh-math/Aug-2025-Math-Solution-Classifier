  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Bailey scored 14 points, and Michiko scored half as many points as Bailey, then Michiko scored 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 points.\nIf Akiko scored 4 more points than did Michiko, then Akiko scored 7+4=11 points.\nSince Chandra scored twice as many points as did Akiko, then Chandra scored 11*2=<<11*2=22>>22 points.\nThus, in total, the team scored 14+7+11+22=<<14+7+11+22=51>>51 points in total during the final game of the season.\n#### 51",
