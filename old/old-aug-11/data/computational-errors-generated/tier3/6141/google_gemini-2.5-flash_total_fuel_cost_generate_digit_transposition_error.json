  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Mallory gammy's house is 2000 miles away and she has to refill the fuel tank every 500 miles, she filled the tank 2000/500 = <<2000/500=4>>4 times.\nIf each refill costs $45, the total amount of money she used on refilling the tank is $45*4 = $<<45*4=810>>810\nThe food cost was 3/5 times as much as the fuel costs, which is 3/5*$810 = $<<3/5*810=486>>486\nOn the whole journey, Mallory expenses on fuel and food costs are $486+$810 = $<<486+810=1296>>1296\n#### 1296",
