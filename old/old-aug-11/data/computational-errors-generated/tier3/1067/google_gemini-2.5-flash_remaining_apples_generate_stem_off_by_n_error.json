  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of apples delivered was: 180 apples x 12 crates = <<180*12=2160>>2160 apples\nSo, the number of remaining apples after throwing away the rotten ones was: 2160 apples - 160 apples = <<2160-160=1980>>1980 apples\nAnd now, we can find the total number of boxes of apples by dividing the remaining number of apples by the number of apples per box: 1980 apples / 20 apples/box = <<1980/20=99>>99 boxes of apples.\n#### 99",
