  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine how many points Righty scored. To do this we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 points since Righty scored half as many as Lefty did.\nThen, to find the other teammate's points we perform 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 points scored, as they scored 6 times as many as Righty did.\nWe then add all three teammates' points together, performing 20+10+60=<<20+10+60=93>>93 points as the first step towards finding the average.\nWe then divide this sum by the total number of players we're averaging, getting 93/3=<<93/3=31>>31 points per player\n#### 31",
