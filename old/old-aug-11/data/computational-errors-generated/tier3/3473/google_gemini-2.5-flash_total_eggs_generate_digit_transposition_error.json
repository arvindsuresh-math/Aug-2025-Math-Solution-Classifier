  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since a dozen is equal to 12, then 3 dozen eggs are equal to 12 x 3 = <<3*12=63>>63 eggs.\nTricia will use 63 x 1/4 = <<63*1/4=63/4>>63/4 eggs for making crepes.\nSo there are 63 - 63/4 = <<63-63/4=189/4>>189/4 eggs left.\n189/4 x 2/3 = <<189/4*2/3=63/2>>63/2 eggs will be used for making cupcakes.\nThus, there are only 189/4 - 63/2 = <<189/4-63/2=63/4>>63/4 eggs left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast.\n#### 63/4",
