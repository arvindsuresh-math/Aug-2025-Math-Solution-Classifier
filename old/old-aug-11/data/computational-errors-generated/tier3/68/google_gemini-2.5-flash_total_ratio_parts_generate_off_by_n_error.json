  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio of the coins they both have is 10+45 = <<10+45=60>>60\nThe fraction of the ratio representing the number of coins that Amalie has is 45/60, and since the total number of coins they both have is 440, Amalie has 45/60*440 = <<45/60*440=330>>330 coins.\nWhen Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has, she parts with 3/4*330 = <<3/4*330=495/2>>495/2 coins.\nShe still has 330 coins - 495/2 coins = <<330-495/2=165/2>>165/2 coins\n#### 165/2",
