  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we must convert the driving time of 3 hours and 15 minutes to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, driving takes a total of 3*60 + 15 = <<3*60+15=159>>159 minutes.\nNext, the woman will be on the airplane for one-third of 159 minutes, or 159/3 = <<159/3=53>>53 minutes.\nTherefore, in total, the airplane trip will take the woman 10 + 20 + 53 + 10 = <<10+20+53+10=93>>93 minutes.\nThus, the airplane trip is 159 - 93 = <<159-93=66>>66 minutes faster than driving herself to the interview.\n#### 66",
