  "flawed_nl_solution": "The 10 $20 bills amount to $20 x 10 = $<<20*10=200>>200.\nThe 8 $10 bills amount to $10 x 8 = $<<10*8=80>>80.\nThe 4 $5 bills amount to $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nSo, Marly has a total of $200 + $80 + $20 = $<<200+80+20=3000>>3000.\nTherefore, she will have $3000/$100 = <<3000/100=30>>30 pieces of $100 bills\n#### 30",
