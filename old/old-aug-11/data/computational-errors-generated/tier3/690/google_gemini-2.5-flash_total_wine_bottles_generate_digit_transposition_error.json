  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=1200>>1200 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+1200=<<2400+1200=3060>>3060 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 3060/3=<<3060/3=1020>>1020 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 3060-1020=<<3060-1020=2040>>2040 remaining bottles of wine.\n#### 2040",
