  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=1200>>1200 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+1200=<<2400+1200=3600>>3600 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 3600/3=<<3600/3=1200>>1200 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 3600-1200=<<3600-1200=24000>>24000 remaining bottles of wine.\n#### 24000",
