  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, or 2400/2=<<2400/2=2100>>2100 bottles of domestic wine.\nIn total, he has 2400+2100=<<2400+2100=4500>>4500 bottles of wine.\nIf the guests drink one-third of all his wine, then they will have consumed 4500/3=<<4500/3=1500>>1500 bottles of wine.\nThus, after the party, Jose's private cellar will have 4500-1500=<<4500-1500=3000>>3000 remaining bottles of wine.\n#### 3000",
