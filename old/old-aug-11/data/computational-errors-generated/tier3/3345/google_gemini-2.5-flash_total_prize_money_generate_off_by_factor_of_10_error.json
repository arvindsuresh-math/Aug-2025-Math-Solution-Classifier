  "flawed_nl_solution": "Rica is left with 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 of her prize money which is equal to $300.\nSince 4/5 is worth $300, then 1/5 is worth $300/4 = $75.\nSo, Rica got $75 x 5 = $375 from their prize money which is 3/8 of the total prize.\nSince 3/8 is equal to $375, then 1/8 is worth $375/3 = $125.\nSo, the total prize money is $125 x 8 = $<<125*8=100>>100.\n#### 100",
