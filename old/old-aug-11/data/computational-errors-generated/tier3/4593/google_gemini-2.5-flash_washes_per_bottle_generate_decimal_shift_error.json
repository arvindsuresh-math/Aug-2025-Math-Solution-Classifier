  "flawed_nl_solution": "A leap year is one day shorter than a regular year, so it is 365 - 1 = <<365-1=364>>364 days.\nBrittany washes her hair every other day, so she will wash it 364 / 2 = <<364/2=182>>182 times in a leap year.\nA bottle of shampoo lasts her 14 / 1 / 4 = 14 * 4 = 35 washes.\nIf she buys 3 bottles, she will only have enough for 35 * 3 = <<3*35=105>>105 washes.\nIf she buys 4 bottles, she will have enough for 35 * 4 = <<4*35=140>>140 washes.\nSince 105 < 182 and 140 > 182, Brittany needs 4 bottles of shampoo to get her through a leap year.\n#### 4",
