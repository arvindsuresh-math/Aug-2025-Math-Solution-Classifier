  "flawed_nl_solution": "If one \"AVN\" is half the price of one \"The Dark\" CD, that means one CD of \"The Dark\" costs 12 * 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.\nSo for 2 \"The Dark\" CDs, Alan needs to pay 24 * 2 = $<<24*2=48>>48.\nSo all CDs cost by now 12 + 48 = $<<12+48=61>>61.\nThe 90s music CDs cost 40/100 * 61 = $<<40/100*61=122/5>>122/5.\nThat means for all CDs Alan needs to pay 61 + 122/5 = $<<61+122/5=427/5>>427/5.\n#### 427/5",
