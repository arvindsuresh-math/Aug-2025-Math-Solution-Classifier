  "flawed_nl_solution": "If one \"AVN\" is half the price of one \"The Dark\" CD, that means one CD of \"The Dark\" costs 12 * 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.\nSo for 2 \"The Dark\" CDs, Alan needs to pay 24 * 2 = $<<24*2=84>>84.\nSo all CDs cost by now 12 + 84 = $<<12+84=96>>96.\nThe 90s music CDs cost 40/100 * 96 = $<<40/100*96=192/5>>192/5.\nThat means for all CDs Alan needs to pay 96 + 192/5 = $<<96+192/5=672/5>>672/5.\n#### 672/5",
