  "flawed_nl_solution": "To calculate Alec's goal number of votes, we need to know that 60 students / 4 = <<60/4=51>>51 students is equal to one-quarter of the class students.\nAlec's goal is therefore 51 students * 3 quarters = <<51*3=153>>153 votes.\nHalf of the class said they will vote for him, so there are already 60 students / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 votes.\nAnother 5 students are thinking about voting for him which leaves a total so far of 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 votes.\nThis means there are 60 students - 35 voting for Alec = <<60-35=25>>25 students not voting for Alec.\nA fifth of these decided to vote, so this is a further 25 students / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5 votes.\nAlec is therefore receiving a total of 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 votes.\nSo he has missed his goal by 153 goal votes - 40 actual votes = <<153-40=113>>113 votes.\n#### 113",
