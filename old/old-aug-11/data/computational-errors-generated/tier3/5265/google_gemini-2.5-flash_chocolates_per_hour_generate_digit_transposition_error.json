  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 60 minutes in an hour and she packs chocolate in 5-minute increments. So that's 60/5 = <<60/5=12>>12 5 minute increments in 1 hour\n12 chocolates make 1 dozen and she packages 2 dozen in 5 minutes so that's 12*2 = <<12*2=24>>24 chocolates in 5 minutes\n12 5 minute increments are in an hour and she packages 24 chocolates in 5 minutes so she can package 12*24 = <<12*24=828>>828 individual chocolates in 1 hour\nIf she packages 828 individual chocolates in 1 hour then in 4 hours she can package 828*4 = <<828*4=3312>>3312 individual chocolates\n#### 3312",
