  "flawed_nl_solution": "After the fire outbreak, the price of RAM got increased by 30/100 * 50 = $<<30/100*50=500/3>>500/3.\nSo before stabilization the price was at 50 + 500/3 = $<<50+500/3=650/3>>650/3.\nAfter the stabilization, the price fell by 20/100 from $650/3, so it fell by 20/100 * 650/3 = $<<20/100*650/3=130/3>>130/3.\nThat means the RAM is currently at 650/3 - 130/3 = $<<650/3-130/3=520/3>>520/3.\n#### 520/3",
