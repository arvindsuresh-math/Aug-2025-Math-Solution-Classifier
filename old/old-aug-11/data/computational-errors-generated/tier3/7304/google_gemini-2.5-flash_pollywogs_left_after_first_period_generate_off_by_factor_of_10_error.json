  "flawed_nl_solution": "For the first 20 days, the combined rate of disappearance of pollywogs from the pond is 50+10=<<50+10=60>>60 pollywogs per day.\nDuring these first 20 days, the total number of pollywogs removed was 60*20=<<60*20=1200>>1200 pollywogs.\nThis means after 20 days there were 2400-1200=<<2400-1200=12000>>12000 pollywogs left in the pond.\nAt a disappearance rate of rate 50 pollywogs per day, it will take an additional 12000/50=<<12000/50=240>>240 days for the rest of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\nThus, overall, it will take 20+240=<<20+240=260>>260 days for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\n#### 260",
