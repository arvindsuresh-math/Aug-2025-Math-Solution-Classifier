  "flawed_nl_solution": "Cersei gave a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cotton candies to her brother and sister.\nSo, the total cotton candies left were 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40.\nAnd she gave 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=160/1>>160/1 cotton candies to her cousin.\nSo, the total number of cotton candies left was 40 - 160/1 = <<40-160/1=-120>>-120.\nTherefore, the total number of cotton candies left after she ate 12 of them is -120 - 12 = <<-120-12=-132>>-132.\n#### -132",
