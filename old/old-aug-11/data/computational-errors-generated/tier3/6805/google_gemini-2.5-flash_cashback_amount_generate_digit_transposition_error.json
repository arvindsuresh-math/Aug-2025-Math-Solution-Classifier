  "flawed_nl_solution": "The discount for an iPhone 12 is $800 x 15/100 = $<<800*15/100=120>>120.\nSo, the iPhone will now cost $800 - $120 = $<<800-120=680>>680.\nThe discount for an iWatch is $300 x 10/100 = $<<300*10/100=30>>30.\nSo, the iWatch will now cost $300 - $30 = $<<300-30=270>>270.\nThe total cost of the iPhone and iWatch is $680 + $270 = $<<680+270=950>>950.\nThe cashback will be $950 x 2/100 = $<<950*2/100=91>>91.\nThus, Dexter will only pay $950 - $91 = $<<950-91=859>>859.\n#### 859",
