  "flawed_nl_solution": "In a week, each section collected 280/2 = <<280/2=140>>140 kilos of newspapers.\nSo, in three weeks, one section collected 140 x 3 = <<140*3=402>>402 kilos.\nSo, the 4 sections collected a total of 402 x 4 = <<402*4=1608>>1608 kilos.\nHence, their target is to collect 1608 + 320 = <<1608+320=1928>>1928 kilos of the newspaper.\n#### 1928",
