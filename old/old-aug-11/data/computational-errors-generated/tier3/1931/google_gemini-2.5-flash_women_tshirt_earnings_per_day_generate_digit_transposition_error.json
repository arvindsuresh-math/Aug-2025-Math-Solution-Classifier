  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the shop is open 12 hours * 60 minutes = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes per day.\nSo, 720 / 30 = <<720/30=24>>24 women's T-shirts sold per day.\nThe shop earns 24 * $18 = $<<24*18=342>>342 selling women's T-shirts per day.\nSimilarly, 720 / 40 = <<720/40=18>>18 men's T-shirts are sold per day.\nThe shop earns 18 * $15 = $<<18*15=270>>270 selling men's T-shirts per day.\nThe shop earns $342 + $270 = $<<342+270=612>>612 per day selling T-shirts.\nThe shop earns $612 * 7 = $<<612*7=4284>>4284 per week.\n#### 4284",
