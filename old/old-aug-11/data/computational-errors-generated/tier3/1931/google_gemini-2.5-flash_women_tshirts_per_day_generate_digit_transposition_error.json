  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, the shop is open 12 hours * 60 minutes = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes per day.\nSo, 720 / 30 = <<720/30=42>>42 women's T-shirts sold per day.\nThe shop earns 42 * $18 = $<<42*18=756>>756 selling women's T-shirts per day.\nSimilarly, 720 / 40 = <<720/40=18>>18 men's T-shirts are sold per day.\nThe shop earns 18 * $15 = $<<18*15=270>>270 selling men's T-shirts per day.\nThe shop earns $756 + $270 = $<<756+270=1026>>1026 per day selling T-shirts.\nThe shop earns $1026 * 7 = $<<1026*7=7182>>7182 per week.\n#### 7182",
