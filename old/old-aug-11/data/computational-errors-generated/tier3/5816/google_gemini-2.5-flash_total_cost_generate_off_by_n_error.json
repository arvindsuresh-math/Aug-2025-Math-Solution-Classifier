  "flawed_nl_solution": "If each movie ticket is sold at $30, the cost of buying eight movie tickets is 8*$30 = $240<<8*30=240>>240\nSince eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of buying one football game ticket is $240/2 = $120<<240/2=120>>120\nBuying 5 football game tickets will cost 5*$120 = $600<<5*120=600>>600\nThe total cost of buying eight movie tickets and five football game tickets is $600+$240 = $844\n#### 844",
