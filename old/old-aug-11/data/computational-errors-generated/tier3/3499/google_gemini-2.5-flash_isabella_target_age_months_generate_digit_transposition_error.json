  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we determine that Isabella will be 10*12= <<10*12=210>>210 months old at age 10, to find a number to compare her age to Antonio's with.\nThen we subtract the 18 months from the total of 210 months to find 210-18= <<210-18=192>>192 months, which is the age Isabella is currently.\nSince at 192 months old Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, we take 192/2= <<192/2=96>>96 months as Antonio's age.\n#### 96",
