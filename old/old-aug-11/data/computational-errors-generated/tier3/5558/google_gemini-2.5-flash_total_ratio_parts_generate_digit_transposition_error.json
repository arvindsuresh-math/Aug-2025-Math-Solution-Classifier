  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the ratio of boys to girls in the math class is 5:8, the total ratio of the number of boys and girls in the math class is 5+8 = <<5+8=31>>31.\nThe fraction that represents the number of boys in the class is 5/31, and since there are 260 students in the class, the number of boys in the class is 5/31*260 = <<5/31*260=1300/31>>1300/31.\nThe number of girls in the class is 260-1300/31 = <<260-1300/31=6760/31>>6760/31.\n#### 6760/31",
