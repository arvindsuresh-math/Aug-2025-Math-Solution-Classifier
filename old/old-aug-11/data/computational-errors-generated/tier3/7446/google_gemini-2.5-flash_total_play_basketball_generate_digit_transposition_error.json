  "flawed_nl_solution": "The students are divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.\nEach part represents 1000/5 = <<1000/5=200>>200 students.\nSo, there are 3 x 200 = <<3*200=600>>600 males.\nAnd there are 2 x 200 = <<2*200=400>>400 females.\nHence, 600 x 2/3 = 400 males play basketball.\nAnd 400 x 1/5 = <<400*1/5=80>>80 females play basketball.\nA total of 400 + 80 = <<400+80=840>>840 students play basketball.\nTherefore, 1000 - 840 = <<1000-840=160>>160 do not like to play basketball.\nThe percentage of the school that do not like to play basketball is 160/1000 * 100 = <<160/1000*100=16>>16\n#### 16",
