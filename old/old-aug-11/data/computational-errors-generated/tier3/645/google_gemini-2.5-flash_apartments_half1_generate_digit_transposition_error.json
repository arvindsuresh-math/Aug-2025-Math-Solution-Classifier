Half the number of floors is 12 floors / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 floors.\nOne half of the block consists of 6 floors * 6 apartments/floor = <<6*6=63>>63 apartments.\nAnd the other half consists of 6 floors * 5 apartments/floor = <<6*5=30>>30 apartments.\nThere are 30 + 63 = <<30+63=93>>93 apartments on all floors in the block.\nAll the apartments can therefore accommodate 93 apartments * 4 residents/apartment = <<93*4=372>>372 residents.\n#### 372",
