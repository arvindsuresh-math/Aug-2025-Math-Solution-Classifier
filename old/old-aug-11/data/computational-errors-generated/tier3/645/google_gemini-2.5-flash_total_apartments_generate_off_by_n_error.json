  "flawed_nl_solution": "Half of the floors have different numbers of apartments. Half the number of floors is 12 floors / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 floors.\nOne half of the block consists of 6 floors * 6 apartments/floor = <<6*6=36>>36 apartments.\nAnd the other half consists of 6 floors * 5 apartments/floor = <<6*5=30>>30 apartments.\nThere are 30 + 36 = <<30+36=63>>63 apartments on all floors in the block.\nAll the apartments can therefore accommodate 63 apartments * 4 residents/apartment = <<63*4=252>>252 residents.\n#### 252",
