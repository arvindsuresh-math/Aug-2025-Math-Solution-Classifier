  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total percentage of those who rated Excellent or Very Satisfactory is 15% + 60% = 75%.\nSeventy-five percent of the parents is 120 x 75/100 = <<120*75/100=90>>90.\nHence, 120 - 90 = <<120-90=35>>35 students rated either Satisfactory or Needs Improvement.\nA total of 35 x 80/100 = <<35*80/100=28>>28 parents rated Satisfactory.\nTherefore, 35 - 28 = <<35-28=7>>7 parents rated Needs Improvement.\n#### 7",
