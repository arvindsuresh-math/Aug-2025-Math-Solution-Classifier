  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many months the loans last: 20 years * 12 months/year = <<20*12=240>>240 months\nThen divide the cost of the house by the number of payments to find the monthly payment before interest: $480000 / 240 months = $<<480000/240=2000>>2000/month\nThen do the same thing to find the monthly payment before interest on the trailer: $120000 / 240 months = $<<120000/240=50>>50/month\nThen subtract the cost of the trailer payment from the cost of the house payment to find the difference: $2000/month - $50/month = $<<2000-50=1950>>1950/month\n#### 1950",
