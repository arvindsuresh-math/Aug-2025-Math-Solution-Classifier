  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since time is obtained by dividing distance and speed, then Skye took 3 km/150 km per hr. = 50/1 of an hour to finish the first 3 kilometers of the race.\nHis speed on the next 2 kilometers was 150 + 50 = <<150+50=200>>200 kilometers per hour.\nHence, it took him 2 km/200 km per hr. = 2/200 of an hour to finish the next 2 kilometers.\nHis speed on the remaining 1 kilometer is 150 x 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 kilometers per hour.\nHence, it took him 1/300 of an hour to finish the 1 kilometer.\nSo, the total time it took for Skye to complete the race was 50/1 + 2/200 + 1/300 = 3751/75 of an hour.\nTherefore, his average speed for the entire race was 6 km/ 3751/75 hour = 450/3751 kilometers per hour.\n#### 450/3751",
