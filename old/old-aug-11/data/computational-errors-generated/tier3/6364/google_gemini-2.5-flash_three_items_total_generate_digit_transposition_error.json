  "flawed_nl_solution": "The chest of drawers sold for half as much as the treadmill, for a price of $100/2= $<<100/2=50>>50.\nThe television sold for three times what he earned for the treadmill, for a price of $100*3= $<<100*3=300>>300.\nFor the three items, he raised $100+$50+$300 = $<<100+50+300=540>>540.\nIf $540 is 75/100 of the total sum of money that Toby made at the garage sale, then the total amount is $540 / (75/100) = $720.\n#### 720",
