  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of laundering all of Leo's trousers is 10 * 9 = <<10*9=90>>90 dollars\nSince the total bill was 140 dollars, this means that all the shirts were cleaned for 140 - 90 = <<140-90=20>>20 dollars.\nAs each shirt is cleaned at 5 dollars, Sudsy Laundry therefore laundered a total of 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 shirts\nThe missing shirts are therefore 4 - 2 = <<4-2=2>>2 shirts\n#### 2",
