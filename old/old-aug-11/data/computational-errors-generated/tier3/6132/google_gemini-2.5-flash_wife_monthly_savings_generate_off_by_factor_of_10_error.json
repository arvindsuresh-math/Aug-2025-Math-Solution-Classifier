  "flawed_nl_solution": "The wife saves $100/week x 4 weeks/month = $4000 a month.\nTogether, the wife and husband save $4000/month + $225/month = $<<4000+225=4225>>4225/month.\nIn 4 months, their total savings is $4225/month x 4 months = $<<4225*4=16900>>16900.\nThey are going to invest $16900 / 2 = $<<16900/2=8450>>8450.\nSo, they can buy $8450 / $50/share = <<8450/50=169>>169 shares of stocks.\n#### 169",
