  "flawed_nl_solution": "The wife saves $100/week x 4 weeks/month = $400 a month.\nTogether, the wife and husband save $400/month + $225/month = $<<400+225=625>>625/month.\nIn 4 months, their total savings is $625/month x 4 months = $<<625*4=25000>>25000.\nThey are going to invest $25000 / 2 = $<<25000/2=12500>>12500.\nSo, they can buy $12500 / $50/share = <<12500/50=250>>250 shares of stocks.\n#### 250",
