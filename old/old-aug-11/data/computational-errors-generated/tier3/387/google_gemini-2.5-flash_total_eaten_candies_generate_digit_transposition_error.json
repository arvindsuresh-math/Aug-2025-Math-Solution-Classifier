  "flawed_nl_solution": "Jacob can eat 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 candies before crying.\nLana can eat 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 candies before crying.\nNellie, Jacob, and Lana all ate until they cried, so they ate 12 + 6 + 3 = <<12+6+3=12>>12 candies.\nThus, there are 30 - 12 = <<30-12=18>>18 candies left in the bucket.\nAfter dividing the remaining candies equally, they will each get 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 sourball candies.\n#### 6",
