  "flawed_nl_solution": "There was an increase of 100 x 15/100 = <<100*15/100=2000/3>>2000/3 visitors in November.\nSo, the number of visitors in November was 100 + 2000/3 = <<100+2000/3=2300/3>>2300/3.\nIn December, the number of visitors was 2300/3 + 15 = <<2300/3+15=2345/3>>2345/3\nTherefore, a total of 100 + 2300/3 + 2345/3 = <<100+2300/3+2345/3=4945/3>>4945/3 visitors listed in these three months.\n#### 4945/3",
