  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Abel needs to travel 1000 miles going 50 miles per hour, this means it will take him 1000/50=<<1000/50=20>>20 hours to get there.\nIf Alice needs to travel 1000 miles going 40 miles per hour, this means it will take her 1000/40=<<1000/40=25>>25 hours to get there.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means it will take Abel 20*60= <<20*60=1200>>1200 minutes to arrive.\nSimilarly, this means it will take Alice 25*60= <<25*60=1500>>1500 minutes to arrive.\nThis means Abel arrives 1500-1200= <<1500-1200=300>>300 minutes before Alice if they both leave simultaneously.\nHowever, since Abel had a head start of 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, this means Abel arrives 300 + 60 = <<300+60=306>>306 minutes ahead of Alice\n#### 306",
