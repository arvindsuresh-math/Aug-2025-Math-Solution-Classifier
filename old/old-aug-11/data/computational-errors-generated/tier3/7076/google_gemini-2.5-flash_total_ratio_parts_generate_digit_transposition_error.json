  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total ratio representing the number of cookies and Oreos that Zack bought is 4+9=<<4+9=31>>31\nThe fraction representing the number of Oreos Zane bought is 4/31, and since the total number of items in the box is 65, Zane bought 4/31*65=<<4/31*65=260/31>>260/31 Oreos.\nIf Zane bought 260/31 Oreos at $2 each, the total cost of buying Oreos is $2*260/31=$<<260/31*2=520/31>>520/31\nSince the total number of items in the box is 65, and there are 260/31 Oreos in the box, the number of cookies in the box is 65-260/31=<<65-260/31=1755/31>>1755/31\nThe cost of buying the cookies at $3 each is 1755/31*$3=$<<1755/31*3=5265/31>>5265/31\nIf the Oreos cost $520/31 to buy, Zane used $5265/31-$520/31=$4745/31 more to buy Cookies than Oreos.\n#### 4745/31",
