  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mikaela spent 35 + 5 = <<35+5=41>>41 hours in the second month.\nSo, she tutored a total of 35 + 41 = <<35+41=76>>76 hours for the first two months.\nThus, her total earning was 76 x $10 = $<<76*10=760>>760.\nAnd, her total expenses was 4/5 x $760 = $<<4/5*760=608>>608.\nTherefore, she saved an amount of $760 - $608 = $<<760-608=152>>152.\n#### 152",
