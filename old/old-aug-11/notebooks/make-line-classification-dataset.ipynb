    "Created on: {pd.Timestamp.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\n",
    "Random seed: {RANDOM_SEED}\n",
    "Strategy: **Flawed-Only with Comprehensive Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset addresses class imbalance by using **only flawed samples** for line-level error detection, with comprehensive preprocessing applied to fix tokenization issues and standardize input format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Class Balance\n",
    "- **Original approach**: ~85-90% zeros (severe imbalance, ratio ~5-6:1)\n",
    "- **Flawed-only approach**: ~{100-total_error_lines/total_line_labels*100:.1f}% zeros (better balance, ratio ~{imbalance_ratio:.1f}:1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Preprocessing Applied\n",
    "- **Line separation**: Replaced newlines with special token `{LINE_SEP_TOKEN}` for reliable tokenization\n",
    "- **Unicode sanitization**: Converted problematic Unicode characters to ASCII equivalents\n",
    "- **User prompt formatting**: Combined question + solution into standardized format\n",
    "- **Text cleaning**: Removed comma separators from numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total samples**: {len(dataset_df):,} (all flawed)\n",
    "- **Unique problems**: {dataset_df['index'].nunique():,}\n",
    "- **Strategy**: Balanced conceptual + computational errors with preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition\n",
    "- **Conceptual errors**: {dict(dataset_df['error_type'].value_counts()).get('conceptual_error', 0)} samples\n",
    "- **Computational errors**: {dict(dataset_df['error_type'].value_counts()).get('computational_error', 0)} samples\n",
    "- **Correct solutions**: 0 samples (removed to eliminate imbalance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Balance Analysis\n",
    "- **Total line positions**: {total_line_labels:,}\n",
    "- **Error lines (label=1)**: {total_error_lines:,} ({total_error_lines/total_line_labels*100:.1f}%)\n",
    "- **Correct lines (label=0)**: {total_correct_lines:,} ({total_correct_lines/total_line_labels*100:.1f}%)\n",
    "- **Imbalance ratio**: {imbalance_ratio:.1f}:1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Column Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `text`: Complete user prompt with system instruction + problem + preprocessed solution\n",
    "- `correct_answer`: Original GSM8K correct answer for reference\n",
    "- `line_labels`: One-hot encoded labels `[0,0,1,0,...]` indicating error line\n",
    "- `error_type`: 'conceptual_error' or 'computational_error'\n",
    "- `index`: Original GSM8K problem index\n",
    "- `tier`: Problem difficulty tier (tier1-tier4)\n",
    "- `source`: 'manual' or 'programmatic'\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import ast\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load dataset\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('flawed_only_line_classification_dataset.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parse line_labels from string representation\n",
    "df['line_labels'] = df['line_labels'].apply(ast.literal_eval)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Check a sample with error\n",
    "sample = df.iloc[0]\n",
    "print(\"User prompt:\")\n",
    "print(sample['text'])\n",
    "print(f\"\\\\nError type: {{sample['error_type']}}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Error line position: {{sample['line_labels'].index(1)}}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Preprocessing ensures reliable newline token detection\n",
    "- **Loss function**: Standard cross-entropy works well (no complex weighting needed)\n",
    "- **Data collator**: Custom collator for variable-length `line_labels`\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Line-level accuracy, precision, recall, F1\n",
    "- **Much more stable training** than severely imbalanced dataset\"\"\"\n",
