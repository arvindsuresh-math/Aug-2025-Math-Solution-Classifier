17,"A snail crawls 5 cm every minute, but then rests for a minute, during which it slides back 2 cm. How many minutes will it take for the snail to be 16 cm away from its starting point for the first time?","In a 2-minute cycle (crawl and rest), the snail makes a net progress.
Net progress per 2 minutes = 5 cm - 2 cm = 3 cm.
To reach 15 cm, it will take 5 such cycles.
Time to reach 15 cm = 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
At 10 minutes, the snail is at 15 cm. In the next minute (the 11th minute), it crawls forward 5 cm.
Position at 11 minutes = 15 + 5 = 20 cm.
Since 16 cm is passed during this 11th minute, we need to find the exact time.
After 10 minutes, the snail is at 15 cm and needs to travel 1 more cm.
Time to travel 1 cm = 1 cm / 5 cm/min = 0.2 minutes.
Total time = 10 minutes + 0.2 minutes = 10.2 minutes. But the question asks how many minutes it will take to be 16cm away. After 10 minutes, it is at 15cm. In the next minute it crawls 5cm. So at 11 minutes it is at 20cm. It passed 16cm during the 11th minute.
Let's re-evaluate. After 8 minutes (4 cycles), the snail is at 4 * 3 = 12 cm.
In the 9th minute, it crawls 5 cm. Position = 12 + 5 = 17 cm.
So, it reaches and passes 16 cm during the 9th minute.

Calculate the number of seats sold.
Seats sold = 1700 * 0.80 = 1360.
Since the unsold seats are proportional, the sold seats are also proportional.
Revenue A = (600/1700) * 1360 * 50 = 0.3529 * 1360 * 50 = $24000.
Revenue B = (600/1700) * 1360 * 40 = 0.3529 * 1360 * 40 = $19200.
Revenue C = (500/1700) * 1360 * 30 = 0.2941 * 1360 * 30 = $12000.
Let's re-calculate proportionally. 80% of seats in each section are sold.
Revenue A = (600 * 0.8) * 50 = 480 * 50 = $24000.
Revenue B = (600 * 0.8) * 40 = 480 * 40 = $19200.
Revenue C = (500 * 0.8) * 30 = 400 * 30 = $12000.
Total revenue = 24000 + 19200 + 12000 = $55200.

Next, calculate the total units produced by Machine B in 8 hours.
Units B = 120 * 8 = 960.
Calculate the number of non-defective units from Machine B.
Good units B = 960 * (1 - 0.04) = 960 * 0.96 = 921.6. Let's assume integer units, so 921.
Let's use the exact number for now. Good units B = 921.6.
Calculate the total number of non-defective units produced.
Total good units = 1080 + 921.6 = 2001.6.

What is the total surface area to be frosted in square centimeters? Use $$\pi \approx 3.14$$.","First, calculate the area of the sides (lateral area) for the bottom layer. Area = 2*pi*r*h.
Side Area Bottom = 2 * 3.14 * 20 * 8 = 1004.8 sq cm.
Calculate the lateral area for the middle layer.
Side Area Middle = 2 * 3.14 * 15 * 8 = 753.6 sq cm.
Calculate the lateral area for the top layer.
Side Area Top = 2 * 3.14 * 10 * 8 = 502.4 sq cm.
Next, calculate the area of the top circular surface of each layer. Area = pi*r^2.
Top Area Bottom = 3.14 * 20^2 = 1256 sq cm.
Top Area Middle = 3.14 * 15^2 = 706.5 sq cm.
Top Area Top = 3.14 * 10^2 = 314 sq cm.
The frosted area on top is the exposed part of each layer.
Frosted Top Area = (Area_B - Area_M) + (Area_M - Area_T) + Area_T = Area_B = 1256 sq cm.
Let's re-read. It says top and sides of EACH layer. This implies they are frosted before stacking.
Total frosted area = (Side_B + Top_B) + (Side_M + Top_M) + (Side_T + Top_T).
Total frosted area = (1004.8 + 1256) + (753.6 + 706.5) + (502.4 + 314) = 2260.8 + 1460.1 + 816.4 = 4537.3 sq cm.

Revenue from first 10k = 10000 * 20 = $200,000.
Royalty from first 10k = 200000 * 0.10 = $20,000.
Next, calculate the number of copies sold beyond the first 10,000.
Additional copies = 25000 - 10000 = 15,000 copies.
Calculate the revenue from these additional copies.
Revenue from additional copies = 15000 * 20 = $300,000.
Calculate the royalty earned from the additional copies.
Royalty from additional copies = 300000 * 0.15 = $45,000.
Finally, calculate the total royalty earned.
Total royalty = 20000 + 45000 = $65,000.

132,"A company has a budget of $1,000,000 for a new project. 40% is allocated to research and development (R&D), 35% to manufacturing, and 15% to marketing. The remaining 10% is a contingency fund. During the project, R&D costs were 10% over budget, and manufacturing was 5% under budget. How much of the contingency fund was used or how much was left?","First, calculate the budgeted amounts for each department.
Budget R&D = 1000000 * 0.40 = $400,000.
Budget Manufacturing = 1000000 * 0.35 = $350,000.
Budget Marketing = 1000000 * 0.15 = $150,000.
Budget Contingency = 1000000 * 0.10 = $100,000.
Calculate the actual cost for R&D.
Actual R&D = 400000 * 1.10 = $440,000. Over budget by $40,000.
Calculate the actual cost for Manufacturing.
Actual Manufacturing = 350000 * 0.95 = $332,500. Under budget by $17,500.
Assume marketing costs were exactly as budgeted.
Calculate the net overage from the main departments.
Net overage = (Actual R&D - Budget R&D) + (Actual Mfg - Budget Mfg) = 40000 - 17500 = $22,500.
This overage must be covered by the contingency fund.
Remaining contingency = 100000 - 22500 = $77,500.

In the first year, the business makes a revenue of $150,000 and has expenses of $80,000. They decide to reinvest 40% of the profit back into the business and distribute the rest. How much money does Alex receive?","First, calculate the total investment.
Total investment = 30000 + 20000 = $50,000.
Calculate Alex's share of the investment.
Alex's share = 30000 / 50000 = 0.6 or 60%.
Calculate the total profit for the first year.
Profit = Revenue - Expenses = 150000 - 80000 = $70,000.
Calculate the amount of profit to be reinvested.
Reinvestment = 70000 * 0.40 = $28,000.
Calculate the amount of profit to be distributed.
Distributed profit = 70000 - 28000 = $42,000.
Finally, calculate Alex's share of the distributed profit.
Alex's take = 42000 * 0.60 = $25,200.

The park's management decides to cover the path with a special rubber material that costs $40 per square meter. They also plant flowers along the outer edge of the path, which costs $10 per meter. What is the total cost for the material and the flowers?","First, calculate the area of the entire park.
Total Area = 120 * 80 = 9600 square meters.
Calculate the dimensions of the inner grassy area (inside the path).
Inner length = 120 - 2 - 2 = 116 meters.
Inner width = 80 - 2 - 2 = 76 meters.
Calculate the area of the inner grassy part.
Grass Area = 116 * 76 = 8816 square meters.
Calculate the area of the path.
Path Area = Total Area - Grass Area = 9600 - 8816 = 784 square meters.
Calculate the cost of the rubber material for the path.
Material Cost = 784 * 40 = $31360.
Next, calculate the perimeter of the outer edge of the path (which is the perimeter of the park).
Perimeter = 2 * (120 + 80) = 2 * 200 = 400 meters.
Calculate the cost of the flowers.
Flower Cost = 400 * 10 = $4000.
Finally, calculate the total cost.
Total Cost = Material Cost + Flower Cost = 31360 + 4000 = $35360.

Then, they put the book on sale at a 20% discount off the selling price and sell another 150 copies. Finally, they put the remaining 50 copies on a clearance table at $9 per book. What was the total profit from selling all 400 books?","First, calculate the initial cost of all 400 books.
Total Cost = 400 * 8 = $3200.
Calculate the regular selling price.
Markup = 8 * 0.75 = $6. Selling Price = 8 + 6 = $14.
Calculate the revenue from the first 200 copies.
Revenue 1 = 200 * 14 = $2800.
Calculate the sale price (20% off $14).
Discount = 14 * 0.20 = $2.80. Sale Price = 14 - 2.80 = $11.20.
Calculate the revenue from the next 150 copies.
Revenue 2 = 150 * 11.20 = $1680.
Calculate the revenue from the final 50 copies.
Revenue 3 = 50 * 9 = $450.
Calculate the total revenue from all sales.
Total Revenue = 2800 + 1680 + 450 = $4930.
Finally, calculate the total profit.
