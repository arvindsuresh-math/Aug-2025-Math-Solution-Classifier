126,"A farmer has a field shaped like a trapezoid. The two parallel sides are 120 meters and 180 meters long. The height of the trapezoid (the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides) is 100 meters. The farmer wants to apply fertilizer that costs $50 per bag, and each bag covers 400 square meters. How much will the fertilizer cost for the entire field?","The area of the trapezoid is ((120 + 180) / 2) * 100 = 15,000 square meters.
The number of bags needed is 15000 / 400 = 37.5, so 38 bags must be bought.
