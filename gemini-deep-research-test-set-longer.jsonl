How much did the fuel for the day's trip cost, and how many liters were left in the tank at the end?", "answer": "First, calculate the total distance traveled.\nTotal distance = 150 + 120 + 180 = 450 km.\nCalculate the total fuel consumed during the trip.\nFuel consumed = 450 km / 5 km/liter = 90 liters.\nThe tank only holds 80 liters, so this trip is not possible as described. Let's assume it refuels. The question asks for the cost of the fuel for the trip.\nCalculate the total cost of the fuel consumed.\nFuel cost = 90 liters * 1.80 $/liter = $162.\nLet's re-read. It asks for cost AND liters left. This implies it started with enough fuel. Let's assume the tank is bigger, say 100 liters, and starts with 80 liters.\nLet's assume the problem is flawed and just calculate the cost. The cost is $162.\nLet's assume the fuel efficiency is 8 km/liter instead.\nFuel consumed = 450 / 8 = 56.25 liters.\nCalculate the cost of this fuel.\nFuel cost = 56.25 * 1.80 = $101.25.\nCalculate the fuel remaining in the tank.\nFuel left = 80 - 56.25 = 23.75 liters.\nLet's stick with the original numbers and point out the issue. The truck needs 90 liters but only has 80. Let's calculate the cost for the 90 liters needed.\nFuel cost = 90 * 1.80 = $162.\nFINAL ANSWER: 162"}

{"question": "A farmer has a field shaped like a trapezoid. The two parallel sides are 120 meters and 180 meters long. The height of the trapezoid (the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides) is 100 meters. The farmer wants to apply fertilizer that costs $50 per bag, and each bag covers 400 square meters. How much will the fertilizer cost for the entire field?", "answer": "First, calculate the area of the trapezoidal field. Area = ((a+b)/2) * h.\nSum of parallel sides = 120 + 180 = 300 meters.\nAverage of parallel sides = 300 / 2 = 150 meters.\nArea = 150 * 100 = 15000 square meters.\nNext, calculate the number of fertilizer bags needed.\nNumber of bags = Area / Coverage per bag = 15000 / 400 = 37.5.\nSince you can't buy half a bag, the farmer must buy 38 bags.\nNumber of bags to buy = 38.\nFinally, calculate the total cost of the fertilizer.\nTotal cost = 38 * 50 = $1900.\nFINAL ANSWER: 1900"}
