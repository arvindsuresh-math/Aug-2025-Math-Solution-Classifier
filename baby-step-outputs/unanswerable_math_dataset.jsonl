{"original_problem": "One dandelion seed floated onto Mrs. Middleton's lawn, landed on good soil, and began to grow.  After one month, the dandelion plant had grown to full size and developed a flower.  At the end of the second month, the flower turned to 50 fluffy, white seeds, which blew onto the lawn.  Only half of these seeds landed onto good soil, germinated, and began to grow, just as the first seed had done.

The original problem states that the box had 16 bandages (24 - 8) before Peggy used any, and she used 5 bandages in total. Logically, there should be 11 bandages left. However, the added sentence claims there are still 24 bandages in the box, directly contradicting the earlier calculation."}
