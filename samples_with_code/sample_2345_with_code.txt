*Question*: 
A curry house sells curries that have varying levels of spice. Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?

*Solution*: 
The curry house previously bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries = <<3*30=90>>90 peppers for very spicy curries.
They also bought 2 peppers per spicy curry * 30 spicy curries = <<2*30=60>>60 peppers for spicy curries.
They also bought 1 pepper per mild curry * 10 mild curries = <<1*10=10>>10 peppers for mild curries.
So they were previously buying 90 + 60 + 10 = <<90+60+10=160>>160 peppers.
They now buy 2 peppers per spicy curry * 15 spicy curries = <<2*15=30>>30 peppers for spicy curries.
They also now buy 1 pepper per mild curry * 90 mild curries = <<1*90=90>>90 peppers for mild curries.
So they now buy 30 + 90 = <<30+90=120>>120 peppers.
This is a difference of 160 peppers bought originally - 120 peppers bought now = <<160-120=40>>40 peppers.
