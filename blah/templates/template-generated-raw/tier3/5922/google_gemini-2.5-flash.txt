To find how many papers she can grade in 11 hours, it would be useful to first find out how many papers she can grade in one hour. To do so, divide {total_papers} papers by {total_hours} hours, {total_papers}/{total_hours}, to get {papers_per_hour}. Therefore, Ms. Alice can grade {papers_per_hour} papers in one hour."
