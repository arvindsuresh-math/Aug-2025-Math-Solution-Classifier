  "flawed_nl_solution": "If each lap is 400 meters long, then 3 laps will have a total distance of 400*3 = <<400*3=12000>>12000 meters\nThe total time he ran was 70 on the first lap + 85 on the second one and 85 on the third lap, so his total running time was = 70+85+85 = <<70+85+85=240>>240 seconds\nHis average speed then is measured by the total distance he ran (12000) divided by the total time required (240) or 12000/240 = <<12000/240=50>>50 m/s\n#### 50",
