  "flawed_nl_solution": "The movie theater made 5 * 32 = $<<5*32=160>>160 in matinee tickets.\nIt made 7 * 40 = $<<7*40=280>>280 in evening tickets.\nIt made 10 * 58 = $<<10*58=580>>580 in opening night tickets.\nThere were 32 + 40 + 58 = <<32+40+58=310>>310 customers.\nHalf of the customers bought popcorn, so 310 / 2 = <<310/2=155>>155 bought popcorn.\nThus, the theater made 10 * 155 = $<<10*155=1550>>1550 from popcorn.\nTherefore, in all, the theater made 160 + 280 + 580 + 1550 = $<<160+280+580+1550=2570>>2570 on Friday night.\n#### 2570",
