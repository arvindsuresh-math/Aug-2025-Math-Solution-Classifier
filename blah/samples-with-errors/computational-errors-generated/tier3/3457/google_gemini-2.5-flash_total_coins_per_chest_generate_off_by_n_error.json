  "flawed_nl_solution": "There will be 3500 gold coins / 5 chest= <<3500/5=700>>700 gold coins in every chest.\nSo, there will be 500 silver coins / 5 chests = <<500/5=100>>100 silver coins in each chest.\nThen, the number of bronze coins is double the number of silver coins, so there are 2 * 500 = <<2*500=1000>>1000 bronze coins.\nSo there will be 1000 bronze coins / 5 chests = <<1000/5=200>>200 bronze coins in each chest.\nFinally, the total number of coins in every chest will be 700 gold coins + 100 silver coins + 200 bronze coins = <<700+100+200=1001>>1001 coins.\n#### 1001",
