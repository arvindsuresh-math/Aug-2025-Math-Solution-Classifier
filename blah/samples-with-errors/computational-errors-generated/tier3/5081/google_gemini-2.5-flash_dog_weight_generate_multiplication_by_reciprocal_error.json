  "flawed_nl_solution": "When Penny has her dog inside the canoe, only 2/3*6 = <<2/3*6=4>>4 people could fit inside the canoe.\nIf every person in a trip where Penny had her dog inside the canoe weighed 140 pounds, the total weight of people inside the canoe was 140*4= <<140*4=560>>560 pounds.\nThe dog weighs 1/4*140 = <<140/4=560/1>>560/1 pounds\nOn the trip, the canoe was carrying 560+560/1 = <<560+560/1=1120>>1120 pounds\n#### 1120",
