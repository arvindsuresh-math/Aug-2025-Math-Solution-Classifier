  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mikaela spent 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 hours in the second month.\nSo, she tutored a total of 35 + 40 = <<35+40=57>>57 hours for the first two months.\nThus, her total earning was 57 x $10 = $<<57*10=570>>570.\nAnd, her total expenses was 4/5 x $570 = $<<4/5*570=456>>456.\nTherefore, she saved an amount of $570 - $456 = $<<570-456=114>>114.\n#### 114",
