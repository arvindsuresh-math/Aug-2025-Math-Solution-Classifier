  "flawed_nl_solution": "The discount for an iPhone 12 is $800 x 15/100 = $<<800*15/100=120>>120.\nSo, the iPhone will now cost $800 - $120 = $<<800-120=680>>680.\nThe discount for an iWatch is $300 x 10/100 = $<<300*10/100=30>>30.\nSo, the iWatch will now cost $300 - $30 = $<<300-30=720>>720.\nThe total cost of the iPhone and iWatch is $680 + $720 = $<<680+720=1400>>1400.\nThe cashback will be $1400 x 2/100 = $<<1400*2/100=28>>28.\nThus, Dexter will only pay $1400 - $28 = $<<1400-28=1372>>1372.\n#### 1372",
