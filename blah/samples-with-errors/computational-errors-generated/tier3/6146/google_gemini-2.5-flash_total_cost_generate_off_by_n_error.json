  "flawed_nl_solution": "Rick's savings are half the price of the gift, which is $250/2 = $<<250/2=125>>125.\nThe total savings for the two siblings is $155 + $125 = $<<155+125=280>>280.\nMom's gift costs $250 + $25 for the cake = $<<250+25=274>>274\nSubtracting the total cost of the gift from the total savings, we get $280 - $274 = $<<280-274=6>>6 left.\n#### 6",
