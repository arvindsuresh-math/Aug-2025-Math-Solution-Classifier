  "flawed_nl_solution": "At the beginning of the rainy season, the tank is filled with 100 x 2/5 = <<100*2/5=500/2>>500/2 liters of water.\nOn the first day of the rainy season, the tank had 500/2 + 15 = <<500/2+15=265>>265 liters of water.\nOn the second day, 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20 liters of water were collected.\nSo, the tank is filled with 265 + 20 = <<265+20=285>>285 liters of water on the second day.\nTherefore, 100 - 285 = <<100-285=-185>>-185 liters of water were collected on the third day.\n#### -185",
