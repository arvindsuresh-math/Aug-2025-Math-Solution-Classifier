  "flawed_nl_solution": "At the beginning of the rainy season, the tank is filled with 100 x 2/5 = <<100*2/5=40>>40 liters of water.\nOn the first day of the rainy season, the tank had 40 + 15 = <<40+15=55>>55 liters of water.\nOn the second day, 15 + 5 = <<15+5=23>>23 liters of water were collected.\nSo, the tank is filled with 55 + 23 = <<55+23=78>>78 liters of water on the second day.\nTherefore, 100 - 78 = <<100-78=22>>22 liters of water were collected on the third day.\n#### 22",
