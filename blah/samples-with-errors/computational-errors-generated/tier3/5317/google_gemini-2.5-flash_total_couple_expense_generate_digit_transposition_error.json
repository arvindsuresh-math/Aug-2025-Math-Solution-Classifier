  "flawed_nl_solution": "The amount that the couple would cover for the hospital bill is $128/2 = $<<128/2=64>>64.\nThe couple's total expenses (salary and hospital bill) is $160 + $64 = $<<160+64=242>>242.\nSo each of them should give $242/2 = $<<242/2=121>>121 in total.\nSince the husband paid the entire half of the hospital bill already ($64), he still needs to pay $121 - $64 = $<<121-64=57>>57.\n#### 57",
