  "flawed_nl_solution": "Combining the tennis and soccer balls, there are 15+5=<<15+5=24>>24 balls in each basket\nThere are 5 baskets, hence 5*24=<<5*24=120>>120 balls in total\n3 students removed 8 balls each, they removed 3*8=<<3*8=24>>24 balls\nFrom the total number of balls, they left 120-24=<<120-24=96>>96 balls\nThere are 56 balls left so the other 2 students must have removed a total of 96-56=40 balls\nThis means that each of these 2 students removed 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 balls.\n#### 20",
