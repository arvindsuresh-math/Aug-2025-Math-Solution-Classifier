  "flawed_nl_solution": "Porter's weekly earning is $8x5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nPorter's monthly earning is $40x4= $<<40*4=160>>160.\nThe extra amount he will earn when he works on his overtime is $8 x 50/100 = $<<8*50/100=16/1>>16/1.\nSo the amount he will earn on his overtime is $8 + $16/1 = $<<8+16/1=24>>24.\nSince he will render overtime once every week, the total overtime pay he will earn in a month is $24 x 4 = $<<24*4=96>>96.\nTherefore the total money he will earn in a week is $160+$96 = $<<160+96=256>>256.\n#### 256",
