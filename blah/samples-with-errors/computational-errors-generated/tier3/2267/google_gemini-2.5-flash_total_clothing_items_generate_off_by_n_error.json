  "flawed_nl_solution": "From the children, there are a total of 11 children * 4 items of clothing each = <<11*4=44>>44 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\nFrom the adults, there are a total of 20 adults * 3 items of clothing each = <<20*3=60>>60 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\nSo there are a total of 44 + 60 = <<44+60=108>>108 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\nThis means that there are 108 items of clothing / 2 items of clothing per clothesline = <<108/2=54>>54 clotheslines.\nThere are 2 clotheslines per house so there must be 54 clotheslines / 2 = <<54/2=27>>27 houses on the street.\n#### 27",
