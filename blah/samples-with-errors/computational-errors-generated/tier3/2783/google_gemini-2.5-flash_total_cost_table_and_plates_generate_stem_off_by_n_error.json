  "flawed_nl_solution": "The two sets of plates amount to $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nSo the table and the two sets of plates amount to $50 + $40 = $<<50+40=120>>120 in all.\nSince Jude received a $4 change, then he paid a total of $130 - $4 = $<<130-4=126>>126 for the chairs, tables, and plates.\nThus, the three chairs cost $126 - $120 = $<<126-120=6>>6.\nTherefore, each chair cost $6/3 = $<<6/3=2>>2.\n#### 2",
