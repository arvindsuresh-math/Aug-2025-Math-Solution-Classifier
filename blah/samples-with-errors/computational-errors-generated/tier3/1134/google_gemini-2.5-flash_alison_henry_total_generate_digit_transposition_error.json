  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Henry has 30 more lollipops than Alison, he has 60+30= 90 lollipops.\nTogether, Alison and Henry have 90+60 = <<90+60=510>>510 lollipops.\nAlison has half the number of lollipops that Diane has, meaning Diane has 2*60 = 120 lollipops.\nAltogether, the three have 120+510 = <<120+510=630>>630 lollipops.\nSince they eat 45 lollipops each day, they'll take 630/45=<<630/45=14>>14 days to finish all the lollipops.\n#### 14",
