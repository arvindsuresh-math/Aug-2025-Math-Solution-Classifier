  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Tenisha has 40 dogs, the number of female dogs is 60/100*40 = 200/3\n3/4 of the females give birth, meaning 3/4*200/3 = <<3/4*200/3=50>>50 female dogs gives birth to puppies.\nSince each dog that gave birth had 10 puppies, the number of puppies that were born is 50*10 = <<50*10=500>>500\nAfter donating 130 puppies to the church, Tenisha remained with 500-130 = 370 puppies.\n#### 370",
