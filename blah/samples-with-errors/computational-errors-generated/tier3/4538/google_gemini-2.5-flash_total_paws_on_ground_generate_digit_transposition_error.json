  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 12 dogs and half are standing on their back legs so that means 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 are standing on their back legs\nA dog has 2 back legs and only 6 are standing on their back legs meaning that there are 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 paws on the ground\nThe other 6 dogs are standing on all 4 legs which means these 6 dogs have 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 paws on the ground\nWhen you add them together 12+24 = <<12+24=63>>63 paws on the ground\n#### 63",
