  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the electricity bill costs $800, and Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, she pays $800+$400 = $<<800+400=1210>>1210 on cell phone expenses.\nSince the cost to enter the tournament is 20/100*1210 = $<<20/100*1210=242>>242 more than her monthly cell phone expenses.\nThe total cost of joining the golf tournament is $1210+$242 = $<<1210+242=1452>>1452\n#### 1452",
