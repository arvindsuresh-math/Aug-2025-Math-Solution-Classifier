  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the electricity bill costs $800, and Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, she pays $800+$400 = $<<800+400=1020>>1020 on cell phone expenses.\nSince the cost to enter the tournament is 20/100*1020 = $<<20/100*1020=204>>204 more than her monthly cell phone expenses.\nThe total cost of joining the golf tournament is $1020+$204 = $<<1020+204=1224>>1224\n#### 1224",
