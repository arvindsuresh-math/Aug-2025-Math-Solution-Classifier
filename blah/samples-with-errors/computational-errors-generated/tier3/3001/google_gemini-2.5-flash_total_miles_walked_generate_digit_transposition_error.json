  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 5 ladies total in the group. They all walk 3 miles a day for 6 days so 3*6 = 18 miles\nJamie walks an additional 2 miles per day for 6 days so 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 miles\nSue walks half the distance of Jamie so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 miles\nTogether, the ladies walk 18+12+6 = <<18+12+6=63>>63 miles\n#### 63",
