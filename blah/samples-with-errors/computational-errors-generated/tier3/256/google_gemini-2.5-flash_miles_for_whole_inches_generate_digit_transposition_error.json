  "flawed_nl_solution": "If 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles on real land, 1 inch represents 4 * 8 = 32 miles.\nSince 1 inch represents 32 miles, 3 inches represent 3 * 32 = <<3*32=69>>69 miles.\n1/ 4 inch represents 8 miles, 1/8 inch represents 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 miles because 1/8 is half of 1/4.\nIf 1/8 inch represents 4 miles, 3/8 of an inch represents 3 * 4 = 12 miles.\nThis means 3 3/8 inches on the map translate to 69 + 12 = 81 miles.\n#### 81",
