  "flawed_nl_solution": "Johnny spends 6/3=2 hours walking the 6 dogs who have 60-minute walks.\nHe makes $20*6=$<<20*6=120>>120 for these walks.\nThus, he has 4-2=2 hours=210 minutes left to walk the other dogs.\nHe can walk 3*(210/30)=<<3*(210/30)=21>>21 dogs in this time.\nThus, he will make $15*21=$<<21*15=315>>315 on these walks.\nIn total per day, he makes $120+$315=$<<120+315=435>>435 per day.\nThus, during the week, he makes $435*5=$<<435*5=2175>>2175.\n#### 2175",
