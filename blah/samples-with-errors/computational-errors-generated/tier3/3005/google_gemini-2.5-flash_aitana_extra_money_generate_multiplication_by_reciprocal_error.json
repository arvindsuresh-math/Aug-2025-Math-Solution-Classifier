  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Jayda spent $400 at the market, Aitana spent 2/5*400 = $2000/2 more on handmade crafts.\nSince Aitana spent $2000/2 more than Jayda at the market, she spent $400+$2000/2 = $<<2000/2+400=1400>>1400.\nThe total amount of money they spent together is $400+$1400 = $<<400+1400=1800>>1800\n#### 1800",
