  "flawed_nl_solution": "Iris and his brother and sister were able to pick a total of 30 + 20 + 10 = <<30+20+10=60>>60 berries.\nThe rotten berries that needed to be thrown away are 1/3 x 60 = <<1/3*60=180/1>>180/1.\nSo, the total number of fresh berries is 60 - 180/1 = <<60-180/1=-120>>-120.\nThe berries they need to keep are 1/2 x -120 = <<1/2*-120=-60>>-60.\nTherefore, the total number of berries they will be able to sell is -120 - -60 = <<-120--60=-60>>-60.\n#### -60",
