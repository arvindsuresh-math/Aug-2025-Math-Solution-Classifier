  "flawed_nl_solution": "Wearing the high-tech shoes, Candace can hike 6 mph * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 mph for the first two hours.\nThen she gets one blister, so her speed drops to 12 mph - 2 mph = <<12-2=6>>6 mph for the next two hours of the hike.\nCandace spends an equal amount of time walking at 12 mph and 6 mph, so we can average the two speeds to find an overall speed of (12 mph + 6 mph)/2 = <<(12+6)/2=9>>9 mph.\n#### 9",
