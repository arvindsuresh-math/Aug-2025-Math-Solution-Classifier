  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Brian caught 400 fish in one trip, he caught 2*400=<<400*2=800>>800 fish in two trips.\nSince Brian catches 2/5 times less fish than Chris per trip, Chris catches 2/5*400=<<2/5*400=2000/2>>2000/2 more fish in one fishing trip.\nChris's total number of fish in one trip is 400+2000/2 = <<400+2000/2=1400>>1400 fish.\nIn 10 trips, Chris catches 1400*10=<<1400*10=14000>>14000 fish.\nIf in his two trips Brian catches 800 fish, and he goes fishing twice as often as Chris, if Chris goes fishing 10 times, Brian will catch 800*10=<<800*10=8000>>8000 fish.\nThe total number of fish they'll catch if Chris goes fishing ten times is 8000+14000=<<8000+14000=22000>>22000\n#### 22000",
