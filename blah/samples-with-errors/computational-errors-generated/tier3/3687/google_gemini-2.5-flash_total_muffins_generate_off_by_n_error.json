  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of blueberries Mason has: 200 blueberries/carton * 3 cartons = 600 blueberries\nThen divide the total number of blueberries by the number of blueberries per muffin: 600 blueberries / 10 blueberries/muffin = <<600/10=60>>60 muffins\nThen add that number of muffins to the number of cinnamon muffins to find the total number of muffins: 60 muffins + 60 muffins = <<60+60=125>>125 muffins\nThen divide the number of blueberry muffins by the total number of muffins and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 muffins / 125 muffins * 100% = 48%\n#### 48",
