  "flawed_nl_solution": "John's mother received 3/8 x $200 = $1600/3<<3/8*200=1600/3>>1600/3.\nHis father got 3/10 x $200 = $60<<3/10*200=60>>60.\nThus, John gave a total of $1600/3 + $60 = $1780/3<<1600/3+60=1780/3>>1780/3.\nTherefore, John had $200 - $1780/3 = $-1180/3<<200-1780/3=-1180/3>>-1180/3 left.\n#### -1180/3",
