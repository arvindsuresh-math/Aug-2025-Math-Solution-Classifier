  "flawed_nl_solution": "First calculate the number of seeds from the sunflowers by multiplying the number of sunflowers by the number of seeds per sunflower: 6 sunflowers * 9 seeds/sunflower = <<6*9=54>>54 seeds\nNext calculate the number of seeds from the dandelions by multiplying the number of dandelions by the number of seeds per dandelion: 8 dandelions * 12 seeds/dandelion = <<8*12=96>>96 seeds\nNow add the number of seeds from each group of plants to find the total number of seeds: 54 seeds + 96 seeds = <<54+96=150>>150 seeds\nNow divide the number of dandelion seeds by the total number of seeds and multiply the answer by 100 to find the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions: 96 seeds / 150 seeds * 100% = 46%\n#### 46",
