  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total number of oranges in all the trees before Dulce picked any is 8 trees * 200 oranges/tree = <<8*200=1600>>1600 oranges.\nIf each orange tree has 200 oranges, and Dulce picks 2/5 of each tree's oranges, she picks 2/5 * 200 oranges = <<2/5*200=1000/2>>1000/2 oranges.\nSince the total number of orange trees is eight, Dulce picked 8 trees * 1000/2 oranges/tree = <<8*1000/2=4000>>4000 oranges from all the trees.\nAfter picking 4000 oranges from the trees, the total number of oranges remaining became 1600 oranges - 4000 oranges = -2400 oranges.\n#### -2400",
