  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Eliza restocked twice the original number of ornamental rings, the number was 200/2= <<200/2=100>>100 rings.\nThe total number of ornamental rings in stock is now 200+100 = <<200+100=296>>296 rings.\nWhen she sells 3/4 of the stock, the total number of rings sold is 3/4*296 =<<3/4*296=222>>222 rings.\nThe remaining stock is 296-222 = <<296-222=74>>74 rings.\nWhen her mother buys 300 more rings, the stock is boosted to 74+300 = <<74+300=374>>374 rings.\nShe then sells out 150, reducing the stock to 374-150 = 224 rings\n#### 224",
