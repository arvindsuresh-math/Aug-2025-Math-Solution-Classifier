  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Eliza restocked twice the original number of ornamental rings, the number was 200/2= <<200/2=100>>100 rings.\nThe total number of ornamental rings in stock is now 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300 rings.\nWhen she sells 3/4 of the stock, the total number of rings sold is 3/4*300 =<<3/4*300=252>>252 rings.\nThe remaining stock is 300-252 = <<300-252=48>>48 rings.\nWhen her mother buys 300 more rings, the stock is boosted to 48+300 = <<48+300=348>>348 rings.\nShe then sells out 150, reducing the stock to 348-150 = 198 rings\n#### 198",
