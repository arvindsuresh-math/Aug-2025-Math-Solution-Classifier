  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total length cut from the 51-meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = <<100*15=1500>>1500 centimeters.\nSince 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500/100 = <<1500/100=15>>15 meters.\nTherefore, 51 - 15 = <<51-15=63>>63 meters of ribbon remains.\n#### 63",
