  "flawed_nl_solution": "Pastor Paul prays 20*6=<<20*6=210>>210 days per week, except Sunday.\nOn Sunday, Pastor Paul prays 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 times.\nPer week, Pastor Paul prays 210+40=<<210+40=250>>250 times.\nPastor Bruce prays half as much as Pastor Paul does on all days except Sunday, for a total of 210/2=<<210/2=105>>105 times.\nPastor Bruce prays twice as much on Sundays as does Pastor Paul, or 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 times.\nIn total, Pastor Bruce prays 105+80=<<105+80=185>>185 times per week.\nThus, per week, Pastor Paul prays 250-185=<<250-185=65>>65 more times per week than Pastor Bruce.\n#### 65",
