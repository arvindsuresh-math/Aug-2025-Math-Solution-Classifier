  "flawed_nl_solution": "On Monday, Steve was paid 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 dollars\nTuesday's harvest was 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 pounds\nThe 24 pounds Steve picked on Tuesday gave him 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 dollars\nSo, the amount Steve earned from the first two days on the job is 16 +48 = <<16+48=64>>64 dollars\nSince Steve rested on Wednesday, he made 0 dollars, meaning his earnings were 64 + 0 = <<64+0=64>>64 dollars\nThe difference between Steve's earnings and his target is 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 dollars\nSince he was paid 2 dollars for each pound of lingonberries, Steve needed to pick 36/2 = <<36/2=81>>81 pounds\n#### 81",
