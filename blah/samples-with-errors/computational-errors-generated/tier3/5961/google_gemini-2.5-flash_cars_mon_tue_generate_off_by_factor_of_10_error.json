  "flawed_nl_solution": "There were 50+50 = <<50+50=10>>10 cars that went through the toll booth on Monday and Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, the number of cars that went through the toll booth is 2*50 = <<2*50=100>>100.\nThe exact number of cars passed through the toll booth on Thursday as Wednesday, giving a total of 100+100 = <<100+100=200>>200 vehicles going through the toll booth in the two days.\nThere were 200+10 = <<200+10=210>>210 cars that passed through the toll booth from Monday to Thursday.\nIf the total number of cars passed through the toll booth in the week was 450, then 450-210 = <<450-210=240>>240 vehicles went through the toll booth on the remaining days.\nSince there were an equal number of cars in the toll booth on each of the remaining days, there were 240/3 = <<240/3=80>>80 cars on each day.\n#### 80",
