  "flawed_nl_solution": "When they added two more courses for the wall, the number of courses became 3+2 = <<3+2=9>>9\nSince each course has 400 bricks, the total number of bricks for 9 courses is 9*400 = <<9*400=3600>>3600\nTo allow for an easy checkup of the wall, they removed 1/2*400 = <<1/2*400=200>>200 bricks from the last course of the wall.\nIn total, the wall has 3600-200= <<3600-200=3400>>3400 bricks.\n#### 3400",
