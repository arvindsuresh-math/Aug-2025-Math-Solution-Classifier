  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many pieces are total in each puzzle. 8 puzzles * 300 pieces each = <<8*300=2400>>2400 pieces.\nNext, 5 puzzles * 500 pieces each = <<5*500=2500>>2500 pieces.\nAll of the puzzles have 2400 pieces + 2500 pieces = <<2400+2500=49000>>49000 pieces total.\nHe will work a maximum of 7 hours each day * 100 pieces per hour = <<7*100=700>>700 pieces per day.\nSo he will end up taking 49000 pieces total / 700 pieces per day = <<49000/700=70>>70 days total.\n#### 70",
