  "flawed_nl_solution": "If there are 4 times as many apples as oranges in a certain fruit basket, with the number of apples being 15, there are 15*4=<<15*4=60>>60 oranges in the basket.\nIf Emiliano eats 2/3 of the oranges in the basket, he would have taken 2/3*60=<<2/3*60=180/2>>180/2 oranges from the basket.\nWith the number of apples in the basket being 15, if Emiliano eats 2/3 of them, 2/3*15=<<15*2/3=10>>10 apples would have been eaten by Emiliano.\nThe total number of fruits eaten by Emiliano will total 10+180/2=<<10+180/2=100>>100\n#### 100",
