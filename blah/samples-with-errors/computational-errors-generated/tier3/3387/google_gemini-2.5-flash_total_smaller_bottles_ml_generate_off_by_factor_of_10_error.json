  "flawed_nl_solution": "Bryan bought a total of 750 + 250 = <<750+250=10000>>10000 milliliters of milk from the two smaller bottles.\nSince 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, then 10000 milliliters is equal to 10000/1000 = <<10000/1000=10>>10 liter.\nTherefore, Bryan bought a total of 2 + 10 = <<2+10=12>>12 liters of milk.\n#### 12",
