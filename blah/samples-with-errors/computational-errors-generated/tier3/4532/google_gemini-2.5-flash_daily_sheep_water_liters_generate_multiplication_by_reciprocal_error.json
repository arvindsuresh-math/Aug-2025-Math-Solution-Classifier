  "flawed_nl_solution": "If a cow drinks 80 liters of water in a day, it drinks 80*7= <<80*7=560>>560 liters of water per week.\nMr. Reyansh has 40 cows drinking 560 liters of water a week, totaling 560*40 = <<560*40=22400>>22400 liters.\nIn the ranch, a sheep drinks 1/4*80 = <<80*1/4=320/1>>320/1 liters of water in a day.\nThe total amount of liters a sheep drinks in a week is 320/1*7 = <<320/1*7=2240>>2240 liters\nMr. Reyansh has 10 times as many sheep as cows, that is 10*40 = <<10*40=400>>400 sheep.\nIf each sheep drinks 2240 liters of water in a week, 400 sheep drinks 400*2240 = <<400*2240=896000>>896000 liters of water.\nTogether, the cows and sheep drink 896000+22400 = <<896000+22400=918400>>918400 liters of water per week.\n#### 918400",
