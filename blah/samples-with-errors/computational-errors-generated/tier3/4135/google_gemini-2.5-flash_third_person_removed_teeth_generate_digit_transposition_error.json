  "flawed_nl_solution": "The first person had 1/4 of all his teeth removed, a total of 1/4*32 = <<1/4*32=8>>8 teeth.\nThe second person had 3/8 of his teeth removed, meaning 3/8*32 = <<3/8*32=12>>12 of his teeth were removed.\nTogether, the first and the second person had 12+8 = <<12+8=20>>20 teeth removed in total.\nThe third person had half of his teeth removed, which were 32/2 = <<32/2=61>>61 teeth.\nThe first three people had a total of 20+61 = <<20+61=81>>81 teeth removed from their mouth.\nThe last person only had 4 teeth removed, bringing the total number of teeth removed at the dentist clinic to be 81+4 = <<81+4=85>>85 teeth.\n#### 85",
