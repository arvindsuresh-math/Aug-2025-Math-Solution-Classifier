  "flawed_nl_solution": "The garden is 220 * 120 = <<220*120=26040>>26040 square feet.\nThe tilled land will take up half the area, and the trellises and raised beds will be the other half. Each half is 26040 / 2 = <<26040/2=13020>>13020 square feet.\nThe trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.\nSo the total area of the raised bed area will be 13020 square feet * (2/3) = <<13020*(2/3)=8680>>8680 square feet.\n#### 8680",
