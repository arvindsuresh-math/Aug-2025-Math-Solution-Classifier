  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find how many months the loans last: 20 years * 12 months/year = <<20*12=240>>240 months\nThen divide the cost of the house by the number of payments to find the monthly payment before interest: $480000 / 240 months = $<<480000/240=20000>>20000/month\nThen do the same thing to find the monthly payment before interest on the trailer: $120000 / 240 months = $<<120000/240=500>>500/month\nThen subtract the cost of the trailer payment from the cost of the house payment to find the difference: $20000/month - $500/month = $<<20000-500=19500>>19500/month\n#### 19500",
