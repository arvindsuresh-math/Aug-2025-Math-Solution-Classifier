  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Diana did 40 situps at a rate of 4 situps/minute, she did situps for 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 minutes\nHani had to do 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 situps per minute if Diana did 4 situps per minute.\nSo over the 10 minutes Hani did 7*10 = <<7*10=70>>70 situps.\nTogether, the total number of situps they did is 70+40 = <<70+40=101>>101\n#### 101",
