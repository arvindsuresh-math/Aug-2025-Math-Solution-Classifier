  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Carla sampled 5 cupcakes from each batch and fed them to her dogs, each batch had 65-5 = 60 cupcakes afterwards.\nSince Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes for her daughter's birthday party, after removing the 5 cupcakes from each batch, Carla's daughter and her friends received 45*60 = <<45*60=2700>>2700 cupcakes.\nThe total number of people at the party is 19 friends + 1 daughter = <<19+1=20>>20\nAfter sharing the cupcakes equally among them, Carla's daughter and her friends each received 2700/20 = <<2700/20=153>>153 cupcakes\n#### 153",
