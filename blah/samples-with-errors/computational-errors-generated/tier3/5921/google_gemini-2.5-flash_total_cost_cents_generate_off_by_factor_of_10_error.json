  "flawed_nl_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.\nAt 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.\nAdding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=100>>100 cents.\nSince each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 100 / 100 = <<100/100=1>>1 dollars\n#### 1",
