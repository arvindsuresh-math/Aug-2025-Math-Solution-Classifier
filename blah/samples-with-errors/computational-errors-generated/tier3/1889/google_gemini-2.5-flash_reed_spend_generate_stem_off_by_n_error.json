  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Trevor spends $20 more than Reed every year to buy toys, Reed spends $80-$20 = $40.\nSince Reed uses $40 every year to buy toys, his friend Quinn uses 40/2 = $<<40/2=20>>20 every year to buy toys.\nThe total amount of money the three spend in a year together to buy toys is $20+$40+$80 = $<<20+40+80=140>>140.\nThe total amount of money the three will use to buy toys in 4 years is $140*4 = $<<140*4=560>>560.\n#### 560",
