  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since 450 liters represents 45%, then each 1% is equal to 450 liters/45 = <<450/45=10>>10 liters.\nHence, the capacity of each tank is 10 liters x 100 = <<10*100=10000>>10000 liters.\nSo, the first tank needs 10000 - 300 = <<10000-300=9700>>9700 liters of water more.\nWhile the second tank needs 10000 - 450 = <<10000-450=9550>>9550 liters more.\nTherefore, 9700 + 9550 = <<9700+9550=19250>>19250 liters of water are needed to fill the two tanks.\n#### 19250",
