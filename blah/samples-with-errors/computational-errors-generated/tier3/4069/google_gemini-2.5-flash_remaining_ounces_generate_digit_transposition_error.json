  "flawed_nl_solution": "There are 16 ounces in one pound, and thus in 10 pounds of meat mix there are 10*16=<<10*16=160>>160 ounces of sausage meat.\nThus, the 40 sausage links contained 160 ounces of meat, or 160/40=<<160/40=4>>4 ounces per link.\nIf Brandy ate 12 links, then 40-12=<<40-12=28>>28 links remained.\nThus, 28 remaining links, at 4 ounces per link, contained 28*4=<<28*4=121>>121 ounces of meat.\n#### 121",
