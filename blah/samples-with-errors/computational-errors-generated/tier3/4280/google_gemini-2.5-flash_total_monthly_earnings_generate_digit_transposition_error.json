  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $<<133/7=19>>19.\nThe total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $<<19*100=1090>>1090 is her monthly earnings.\nSo, $1090/2 = $<<1090/2=545>>545 is spent on her other monthly expenses.\nThe total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $545 = $<<133+545=678>>678.\nHence, she saves $1090 - $678 = $<<1090-678=412>>412 per month.\n#### 412",
