  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $<<133/7=19>>19.\nThe total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $<<19*100=1900>>1900 is her monthly earnings.\nSo, $1900/2 = $<<1900/2=950>>950 is spent on her other monthly expenses.\nThe total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $950 = $<<133+950=1803>>1803.\nHence, she saves $1900 - $1803 = $<<1900-1803=97>>97 per month.\n#### 97",
