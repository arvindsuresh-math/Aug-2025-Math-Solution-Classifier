  "flawed_nl_solution": "If each movie ticket is sold at $30, the cost of buying eight movie tickets is 8*$30 = $204<<8*30=204>>204\nSince eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of buying one football game ticket is $204/2 = $102<<204/2=102>>102\nBuying 5 football game tickets will cost 5*$102 = $510<<5*102=510>>510\nThe total cost of buying eight movie tickets and five football game tickets is $510+$204 = $714\n#### 714",
