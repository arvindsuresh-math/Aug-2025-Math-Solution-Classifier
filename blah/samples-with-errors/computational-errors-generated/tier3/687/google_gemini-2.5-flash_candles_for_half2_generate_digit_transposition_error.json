  "flawed_nl_solution": "For half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 1 candle each. Since half of the cupcakes is 24/2 and she plans to use 1 candle each for this half of the cupcakes, Stephanie needs (24/2)*1 = <<24/2*1=12>>12 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nFor the other half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 2 candles. Therefore, she will need (24/2)*2 =<<24/2*2=42>>42 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nBecause Stephanie needs 12 candles for half of the cupcakes and 42 candles for the other half, she needs a total of 12+42=<<12+42=54>>54 candles.\nSince Stephanie needs 54 candles to decorate all the cupcakes and she currently has 30 candles, Stephanie needs 54-30= <<54-30=24>>24 additional candles.\n#### 24",
