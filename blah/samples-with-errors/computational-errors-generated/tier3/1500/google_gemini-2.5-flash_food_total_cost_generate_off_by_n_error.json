  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total amount spent on food is $40 + $15 + $25 = $<<40+15+25=75>>75.\nThe service charge is $75 x 10/100 = $<<75*10/100=15/2>>15/2.\nThe tip is $75 x 5/100 = $<<75*5/100=15/4>>15/4.\nSo, Mr. Arevalo had to pay $75 + $15/2 + $15/4 = $<<75+15/2+15/4=345/4>>345/4 in all.\nTherefore, his change will only be $100 - $345/4 = $<<100-345/4=55/4>>55/4.\n#### 55/4",
