  "flawed_nl_solution": "For March, April, September and October, she cuts her lawn 2 a month. There are 4 months so she cuts her yard 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 times\nFor May, June, July and August, she cuts her lawn 4 times a month. There are 4 months so she cuts her yard 4*4 = <<4*4=16>>16 times\nDuring the entire 8 month period, she cuts her lawn 8+16 = <<8+16=24>>24 times\nEvery 4th time she cuts, she needs 2 gallons of gas. If she cuts her lawn 24 times a year then she needs to fill up 24/4 = 6 times\nEach time she fills up, it takes 2 gallons of gas so 2*6 = <<2*6=21>>21 gallons of gas per year\n#### 21",
