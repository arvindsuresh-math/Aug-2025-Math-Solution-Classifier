  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each of the 2 hoses delivers water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute, for a combined total of 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 gallons of water per minute.\nThe other 2 hoses each deliver water at a rate of 3 gallons per minute, for a combined total of 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 gallons of water per minute.\nThus, all four hoses deliver a combined total of 4+6=<<4+6=5>>5 gallons of water per minute.\nWith a volume of 15000 gallons, it would take 15000/5=<<15000/5=3000>>3000 minutes to fill the pool.\nConverting to hours, it will take 3000/60=<<3000/60=50>>50 hours to fill the pool.\n#### 50",
