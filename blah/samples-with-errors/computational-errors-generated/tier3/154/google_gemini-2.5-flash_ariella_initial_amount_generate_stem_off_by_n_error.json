  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Ariella has $200 more in her son's saving account than Daniella has, then she has $400 + $200 = $630\nIf she earns an interest of 10% in the first year, her savings account increases by 10/100 * $630 = $<<10/100*630=63>>63\nIn the second year, she earns the same amount of interest, which $63 + $63 = $<<63+63=126>>126\nThe total amount of money in Ariella's account after two years is $630 + $126 = $<<630+126=756>>756\n#### 756",
