  "flawed_nl_solution": "Rick starts with 400 books and divides them into two categories of equal size, meaning there are two categories of 400/2= <<400/2=200>>200 books.\nRick repeats this process again, dividing the 200 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 books in each.\nRick repeats this process again, dividing the 100 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 100/2=<<100/2=50>>50 books in each.\nRick repeats this process again, dividing the 50 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 50/2=<<50/2=52>>52 books in each.\nSince Rick is looking for categories with 25 books in each, he accomplishes this by the 1th step.\n#### 1",
