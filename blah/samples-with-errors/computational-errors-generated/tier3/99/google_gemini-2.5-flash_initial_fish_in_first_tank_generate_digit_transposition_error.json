  "flawed_nl_solution": "The second tank is 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24>>24 gallons.\nFollowing her rule, Gail keeps 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 two-inch fish in the second tank.\nShe keeps 48 / 3 = <<48/3=61>>61 fish in the first tank.\nIf one fish in the first tank ate another, she would have 61 - 1 = <<61-1=60>>60 fish in the first tank.\nThus, Gail would have 60 - 12 = <<60-12=48>>48 more fish in the first tank.\n#### 48",
