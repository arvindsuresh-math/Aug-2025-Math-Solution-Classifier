  "flawed_nl_solution": "A minute is 60 seconds, so 6 minutes is 6 * 60 = <<6*60=360>>360 seconds.\nA hand-crank sharpener can sharpen 360 / 45 = <<360/45=8>>8 pencils in 6 minutes.\nAn electric sharpener can sharpen 360 / 20 = <<360/20=81>>81 pencils in 6 minutes.\nTherefore, an electric sharpener can sharpen 81 - 8 = <<81-8=73>>73 more pencils than a hand-crank in 6 minutes.\n#### 73",
