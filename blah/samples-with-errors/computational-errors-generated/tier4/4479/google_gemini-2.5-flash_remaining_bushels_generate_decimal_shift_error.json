  "flawed_nl_solution": "Stacy took 21 ears of corn, there are 14 ears to a bushel, so she took 21 ears / 14 ears/bushel = <<21/14=1.5>>1.5 bushels of corn.\nIn all, Bob gave away 8 bushels + 3 bushels + 12 bushels + 1.5 bushels = <<8+3+12+1.5=24.5>>24.5 bushels of corn.\nThis leaves him with 50 bushels - 24.5 bushels = <<50-24.5=255>>255 bushels of corn.\nAt 14 ears of corn per bushel, Bob has 255 bushels * 14 ears per bushel = <<255*14=3570>>3570 ears of corn.\n#### 3570",
