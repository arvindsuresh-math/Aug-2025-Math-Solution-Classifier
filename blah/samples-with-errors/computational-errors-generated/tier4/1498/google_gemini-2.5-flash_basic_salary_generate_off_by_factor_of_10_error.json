  "flawed_nl_solution": "Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.5 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=120>>120.\nHer total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nThus, her total earning is $120 + $4000 = $<<120+4000=4120>>4120.\nHer monthly budget aside from the insurance is $4120 x 95/100 = $<<4120*95/100=3914>>3914.\nTherefore, she allocated $4120 - $3914 = $<<4120-3914=206>>206 on insurance.\n#### 206",
