  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of hours Brendan works for the 8-hour shifts: 2 shifts * 8 hours/shift = <<2*8=61>>61 hours\nThen find the total number of hours Brendan works by adding those hours to the 12-hour shift: 61 hours + 12 hours = <<61+12=73>>73 hours\nNow find Brendan's total wage earnings by multiplying his $6/hour wage by the number of hours he works: $6/hour * 73 hours = $<<6*73=438>>438/week\nNow figure out how much Brendan makes in tips by multiplying the number of hours he works by the amount of tips he makes per hour: $12/hour * 73 hours/week = $<<12*73=876>>876/week\nNow divide that number by 3, since Brendan only reports a third of his tips: $876/week / 3 = $<<876/3=292>>292/week\nNow add Brendan's wage earnings to that number to find how much income he reports to the IRS each week: $438/week + $292/week = $<<438+292=730>>730/week\nFinally, multiply Brendan's reported income by his tax rate to find how much he pays in taxes each week: $730/week * 0.2 = $<<730*0.2=146>>146/week\n#### 146",
