  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how much money Nigella earned from commission by subtracting her base salary from her total earnings: $8000 - $3000 = $<<8000-3000=5000>>5000.\nNext, figure out how much all three houses cost by dividing Nigella's commission money by her commission rate: $5000 / 0.02 = $<<5000/0.02=250000>>250000.\nWe can combine like terms to find that 6A - $110000 = $250000.\nNow we add $110000 to both sides of the equation and get 6A = $360000.\nWe can divide both sides by 6 to find A = $600000.\n#### 600000",
