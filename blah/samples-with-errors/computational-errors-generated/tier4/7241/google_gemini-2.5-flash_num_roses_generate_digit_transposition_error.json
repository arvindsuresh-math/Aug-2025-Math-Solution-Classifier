  "flawed_nl_solution": "Claire has 400 - 120 = <<400-120=208>>208 roses in her garden.\nThus, she has 208 - 80 = <<208-80=128>>128 red roses.\nOne-half of the red roses is equal to 1/2 x 128 = <<1/2*128=64>>64.\nTherefore, Claire will earn $0.75 x 64 = $48 if she can sell 1/2 of the total number of red roses.\n#### 48",
