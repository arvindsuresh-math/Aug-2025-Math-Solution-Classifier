  "flawed_nl_solution": "The truck driver drives for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she drives 10*30=<<10*30=3000>>3000 miles.\nTherefore, she needs 3000/10=<<3000/10=300>>300 gallons of gas.\nThis will cost her 300*$2=$<<300*2=600>>600.\nShe will make 3000*$0.5= $<<3000*0.5=1500>>1500.\nThus, after paying for gas, she will make $1500-$600=$<<1500-600=900>>900.\n#### 900",
