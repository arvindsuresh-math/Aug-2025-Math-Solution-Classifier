  "flawed_nl_solution": "The school got a $150 x 5/100 = $<<150*5/100=7.5>>7.5 seminar fee discount for each teacher.\nEach teacher's seminar fee costs $150 - $7.5 = $<<150-7.5=1425>>1425.\nSo, 10 teachers' seminar fees cost $1425 x 10 = $14250.\nThe food allowance for 10 teachers amounts to $10 x 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100.\nTherefore, the school spent a total of $14250 + $100 = $<<14250+100=14350>>14350.\n#### 14350",
