  "flawed_nl_solution": "First we must determine the percentage of the grey and green stones. We add the two amounts together, finding 40+60=<<40+60=100>>100\nWe then figure out that 40/100=<<40/100=0.04>>0.04, meaning 40 percent of the stones are grey in the second selection.\nThis means that 1-0.04= <<1-0.04=0.96>>0.96, or 60 percent of the stones are green.\nTherefore, to find the number of white stones we multiply 100*0.96= 96 white stones.\n#### 96",
