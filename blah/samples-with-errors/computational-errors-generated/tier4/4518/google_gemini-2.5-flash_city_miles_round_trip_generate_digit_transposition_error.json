  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many city miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one-way number of city miles by 2: 60 miles * 2 = <<60*2=210>>210 miles\nThen figure out how many highway miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one-way number of highway miles by 2: 200 miles * 2 = <<200*2=400>>400 miles\nNow divide the round-trip number of city miles by the number of city miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 210 miles / 30 mpg = <<210/30=7>>7 gallons\nNow divide the round-trip number of highway miles by the number of highway miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 400 miles / 40 mpg = <<400/40=10>>10 gallons\nNow add the gallons for the highway miles and the city miles to find the total number of gallons Carl needs to buy: 10 gallons + 7 gallons = <<10+7=17>>17 gallons\nFinally, multiply the number of gallons Carl needs to buy by the cost per gallon to find out how much he spends: 17 gallons * $3 = $<<17*3=51>>51\n#### 51",
