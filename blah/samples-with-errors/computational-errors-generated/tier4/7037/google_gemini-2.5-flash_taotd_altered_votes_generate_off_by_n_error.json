  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of The Art of the Deal votes Fran throws away: 80% * 20 votes = <<80*0.01*20=16>>16 votes\nThen subtract these votes from the total number of The Art of the Deal votes to find the altered number: 20 votes - 16 votes = <<20-16=9>>9 votes\nThen divide the total number Twilight votes by 2 to find the altered number of votes: 12 votes / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 votes\nThen add the altered number of votes for each book to find the total altered number of votes: 6 votes + 9 votes + 10 votes = <<6+9+10=25>>25 votes\nThen divide the number of votes for Game of Thrones by the total altered number of votes and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 votes / 25 votes * 100% = 40%\n#### 40",
