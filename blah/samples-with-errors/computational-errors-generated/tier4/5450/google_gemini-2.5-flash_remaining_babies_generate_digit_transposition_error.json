  "flawed_nl_solution": "Each kettle has 15 hawks that get pregnant and each one yields 4 babies per pregnancy so there are 15 * 4= <<15*4=60>>60 babies expected per kettle.\nIf 60 baby hawks are expected per kettle and the ornithologists are tracking 6 kettles total then there are 60 * 6=<<60*6=360>>360 baby hawks expected across all six kettles this breeding season.\nIf there 25% of eggs do not hatch, then we are looking for 25 (percent that do not make it) /100 (total number of babies expected)=<<25/100=0.25>>0.25 (percentage converted to decimal form for the proportion of expected baby hawks to be lost).\nThe total number of baby hawks expected equals 360 * 0.25 expected los s= <<360*0.25=90>>90 babies not expected to hatch (lost).\nThere are 360 total number of baby hawks expected and there are 90 babies expected to be lost so 360-90= <<360-90=207>>207 remaining baby hawks expected this breeding season\n#### 207",
