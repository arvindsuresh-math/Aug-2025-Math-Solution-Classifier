  "flawed_nl_solution": "Leila and her friends will travel a total distance of 150 x 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 kilometers back-and-forth.\nThey will need 300/15 = <<300/15=20>>20 liters of gasoline for this trip.\nSo, they will pay $0.9 x 20 = $<<0.9*20=18>>18 for the gasoline.\nThus, the first option will costs them $50 + $18 = $<<50+18=67>>67.\nTherefore, they can save $90 - $67 = $<<90-67=23>>23 if they choose the first option.\n#### 23",
