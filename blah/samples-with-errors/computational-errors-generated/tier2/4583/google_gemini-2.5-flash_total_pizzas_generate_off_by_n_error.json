  "flawed_nl_solution": "Ruby was going to order 1 for her son, 1 for her daughter and 1 to share with her husband. So she needed to order 1+1+1 = <<1+1+1=6>>6 pizzas\nEach pizza cost $10 and she was ordering 6 so that comes to 10*6 = $<<10*6=60>>60\nShe needed to order pepperoni, sausage, black olive and mushroom, which came to 4 toppings at $1 each so 4*1 = $<<4*1=4>>4 extra for toppings\nThe pizzas cost $60 and $4 for the toppings so the total costs of the pizzas came to 60+4 = $<<60+4=64>>64\nShe also had to add a $5 tip to her current order total of $64 so 5+64 = $<<5+64=69>>69 for the total order\n#### 69",
