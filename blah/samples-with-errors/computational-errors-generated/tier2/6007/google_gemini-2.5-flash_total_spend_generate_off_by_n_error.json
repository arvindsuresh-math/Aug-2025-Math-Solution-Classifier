  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of 3 packets of pumpkin seeds is 3 x $2.5 = $<<3*2.5=7.5>>7.5.\nThe cost of 4 packets of tomato seeds is 4 x $1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6>>6.\nAnd, the cost of 5 packets of chili pepper seeds is 5 x $0.9 = $4.5. Therefore, Harry will spend $7.5 + $6 + $4.5 = $<<7.5+6+4.5=20>>20.\n#### 20",
