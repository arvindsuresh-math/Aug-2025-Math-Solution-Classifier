  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we find out how many people live in each building. In addition to 10 1 person apartments, as a studio apartment is for a single person, there are 20 2 person apartments meaning there are 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 people capable of living there.\nWe then find out how many people can live in the 4 person apartments by multiplying the number of available 5 person apartments by 4, performing 5*4=20 people capable of living there.\nSo, in 1 building there is room for 10+40+20=<<10+40+20=50>>50 people.\nWe multiply this by the 4 buildings in total, finding a maximum occupancy of 4*50=<<4*50=200>>200 people\nWe then multiply this by 0.75 to find out how many people would live there at 75% of maximum occupancy, performing 200*0.75= <<150=150>>150 people.\n#### 150",
