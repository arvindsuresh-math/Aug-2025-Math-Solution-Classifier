  "flawed_nl_solution": "Mr. Deane will spend $1.4/liter x 10 liters = $<<1.4*10=14>>14 for the 10 liters of gas today.\nThe price of the gas per liter on Friday will be $1.4/liter - $0.4/liter = $<<1.4-0.4=10>>10/liter.\nSo, he will spend $10/liter x 25 liters = $<<10*25=250>>250 for the 25 liters of gas on Friday.\nThus, Mr. Deane will spend a total of $14 + $250 = $<<14+250=264>>264 for the 35 liters of gas.\n#### 264",
