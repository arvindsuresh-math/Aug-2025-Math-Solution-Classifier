  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bedroom set is $2000 and it's currently 15% off so 2000*0.15 = $<<2000*0.15=30>>30 off\nSo the new price of the set is 2000-30 = $<<2000-30=1970>>1970\nHe signs up for the credit card so that's 10% off so 0.1*1970 = $<<10*0.01*1970=197>>197\nNow the set is 1970-197 = $<<1970-197=1773>>1773\nHe has a $200 gift card which brings the price to 1773-200 = $1573\n#### 1573",
