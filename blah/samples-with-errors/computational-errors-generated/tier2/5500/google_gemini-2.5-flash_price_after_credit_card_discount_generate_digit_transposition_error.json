  "flawed_nl_solution": "The bedroom set is $2000 and it's currently 15% off so 2000*0.15 = $<<2000*0.15=300>>300 off\nSo the new price of the set is 2000-300 = $<<2000-300=1700>>1700\nHe signs up for the credit card so that's 10% off so 0.1*1700 = $<<10*0.01*1700=170>>170\nNow the set is 1700-170 = $<<1700-170=1350>>1350\nHe has a $200 gift card which brings the price to 1350-200 = $1150\n#### 1150",
