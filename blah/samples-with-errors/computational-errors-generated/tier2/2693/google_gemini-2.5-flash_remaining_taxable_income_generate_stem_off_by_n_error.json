  "flawed_nl_solution": "His taxable income is 100000-30000=<<100000-30000=70000>>70000\nSo he pays 20000*0.1=<<20000*0.1=2000>>2000 tax at the lower rate\nHe has to pay 70000-20000=<<70000-20000=49980>>49980 at the higher rate\nThe taxes for that is 49980*0.2=<<49980*0.2=9996>>9996\nSo his total tax bill is 9996+2000=<<9996+2000=11996>>11996\n#### 11996",
