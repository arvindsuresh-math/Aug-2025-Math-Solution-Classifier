  "flawed_nl_solution": "If the business's stock price rises 30%, then his share on the company is worth 30% multiplied by $2000 plus $2000 that he already had. That results in 30% * $2000 + $2000 = $600 + $2000 = $<<30*0.01*2000+2000=2599>>2599.\nSince he already had $300, with $2599 more he will have $300 + $2599 = $<<300+2599=2899>>2899.\n#### 2899",
