  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since Mary first weighed 99 pounds, after she dropped a dozen pounds she weighed 99-12=<<99-12=91>>91 pounds.\nTwice the weight she initially lost is 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 pounds.\nSo, when she added back twice the weight that she initially lost, her weight jumped to 91+24=<<91+24=115>>115 pounds.\nThree times more than she initially had lost is 12*3=<<12*3=36>>36 pounds.\nTherefore, when Mary lost 3 times more than she initially lost, her weight dropped to 115-36=<<115-36=79>>79 pounds.\nFinally, when Mary gained back half of a dozen pounds, her final weight was 79+6=<<79+6=85>>85 pounds.\n#### 85",
