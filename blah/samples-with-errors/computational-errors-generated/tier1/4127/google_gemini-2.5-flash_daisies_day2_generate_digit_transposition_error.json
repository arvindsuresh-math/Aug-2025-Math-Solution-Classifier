  "flawed_nl_solution": "The flower shop sold 45 + 20 = <<45+20=56>>56 daisies on the second day.\nTwice the number of flowers on the second day is 56 x 2 = <<56*2=112>>112.\nSo, the flower shop sold 112 - 10 = <<112-10=102>>102 daisies on the third day.\nThe total daisies sold for 3 days was 45 + 56 + 102 = <<45+56+102=203>>203.\nTherefore, 350 - 203 = <<350-203=147>>147 daisies were sold on the 4th day.\n#### 147",
