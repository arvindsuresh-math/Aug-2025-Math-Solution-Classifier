  "flawed_nl_solution": "Initially, there were 6 boxes * 4 washing machines per box = <<6*4=24>>24 washing machines in each crate.\nSo there were 24 washing machines per crate * 10 crates = <<24*10=240>>240 washing machines in the shipping container.\nA worker removes 1 washing machine from each box so there are now 4 original washing machines - 1 removed washing machine = <<4-1=2>>2 washing machines in each box.\nThis means there are 6 boxes * 2 washing machines per box = <<6*2=12>>12 washing machines in each crate.\nSo there are now 12 washing machines per crate * 10 crates = <<12*10=120>>120 washing machines in the shipping container.\nThe difference is how many machine washing machines were removed which is 240 initial washing machines - 120 current washing machines = <<240-120=120>>120 washing machines.\n#### 120",
