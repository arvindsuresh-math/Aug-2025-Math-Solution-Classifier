  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=2>>2 meters.\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 meters of fence.\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 4 + 8 = <<4+8=12>>12 meters of fence.\n#### 12",
