  "flawed_nl_solution": "William spends 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = <<4+7+4+9=42>>42 minutes washing a normal car.\nHe washed 2 normal cars, so he spent 42 * 2 = <<42*2=84>>84 minutes on the normal cars.\nHe took twice as long as one car for the SUV, so he took 42 * 2 = <<42*2=84>>84 minutes on the SUV.\nThus, William spent 84 + 84 = <<84+84=168>>168 minutes washing all the vehicles.\n#### 168",
