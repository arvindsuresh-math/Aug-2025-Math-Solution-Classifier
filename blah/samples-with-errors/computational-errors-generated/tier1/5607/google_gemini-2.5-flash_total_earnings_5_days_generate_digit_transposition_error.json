  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine how much Johnny makes in one day. To start, we perform 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 dollars for the first job.\nSecond, we perform 2*10=<<20=20>>20 dollars for the second job.\nThird, we perform 4*12= <<4*12=48>>48 dollars for the third job.\nAltogether, Johnny makes 21+20+48= <<21+20+48=89>>89 dollars in a day.\nWe multiply this amount by the 5 days, performing 5*89= <<454=454>>454 dollars over 5 days\n#### 454",
