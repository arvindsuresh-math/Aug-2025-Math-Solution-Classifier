  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday is 2445 + 900 = <<2445+900=3345>>3345 bottles\nEach day of the rest of the week, 50 bottles were sold, that is 5 * 50 = <<50*5=520>>520 bottles sold.\nNow the total of bottles sold in a week is 3345 + 520= <<3345+520=3865>>3865 bottles\nThe drugstore has in stock 4500 - 3865= <<4500-3865=635>>635 bottles\nFinally the drugstore has 635 + 650 the supplier brought = <<635+650=1285>>1285 bottles at the end of the week.\n#### 1285",
