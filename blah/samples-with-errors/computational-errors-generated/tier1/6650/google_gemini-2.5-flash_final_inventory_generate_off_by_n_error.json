  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday is 2445 + 900 = <<2445+900=3345>>3345 bottles\nEach day of the rest of the week, 50 bottles were sold, that is 5 * 50 = <<50*5=250>>250 bottles sold.\nNow the total of bottles sold in a week is 3345 + 250= <<3345+250=3595>>3595 bottles\nThe drugstore has in stock 4500 - 3595= <<4500-3595=905>>905 bottles\nFinally the drugstore has 905 + 650 the supplier brought = <<905+650=1559>>1559 bottles at the end of the week.\n#### 1559",
