  "flawed_nl_solution": "The number of bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday is 2445 + 900 = <<2445+900=3435>>3435 bottles\nEach day of the rest of the week, 50 bottles were sold, that is 5 * 50 = <<50*5=250>>250 bottles sold.\nNow the total of bottles sold in a week is 3435 + 250= <<3435+250=3685>>3685 bottles\nThe drugstore has in stock 4500 - 3685= <<4500-3685=815>>815 bottles\nFinally the drugstore has 815 + 650 the supplier brought = <<815+650=1465>>1465 bottles at the end of the week.\n#### 1465",
