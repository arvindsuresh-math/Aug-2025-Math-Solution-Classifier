  "flawed_nl_solution": "The square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \n25=5 inches.\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=8>>8 inches\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 8+5=<<8+5=13>>13 inches.\n#### 13",
