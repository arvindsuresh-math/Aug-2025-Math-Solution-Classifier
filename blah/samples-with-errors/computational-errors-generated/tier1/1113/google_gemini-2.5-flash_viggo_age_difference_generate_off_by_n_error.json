  "flawed_nl_solution": "Twice Viggo's younger brother's age when his brother was 2 is 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 years.\nIf Viggo's age was 10 more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2, Viggo was 10+4 = 14 years old.\nViggo is 14 years - 2 years = <<14-2=9>>9 years older than his brother\nSince Viggo's brother is currently 10 and Vigo is 9 years older, he's currently 10 + 9 = <<10+9=19>>19 years old\nTheir combined age is 19 years + 10 years = <<19+10=29>>29 years\n#### 29",
