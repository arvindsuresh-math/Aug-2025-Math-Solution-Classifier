  "flawed_nl_solution": "Frank stars by taking 10 steps forward from a position 5 steps behind where he started, so he's 10-5= <<10-5=3>>3 steps forward in total\nFrank then takes 2 steps back, meaning he's now 3-2=<<3-2=1>>1 steps forward in total from where he began\nHe then takes double the previous amount of 2 steps forward, so he takes 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 steps forward\nSince Frank was 1 steps forward before that, that means Frank finishes 1+4=<<1+4=5>>5 steps forward\n#### 5",
