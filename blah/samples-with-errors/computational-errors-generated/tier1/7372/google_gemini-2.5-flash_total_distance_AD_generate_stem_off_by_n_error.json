  "flawed_nl_solution": "Since the distance between city A and B is 100 miles, and city B and C are 50 more miles apart than city A and B, then city B and C are 100+50 = <<100+50=150>>150 miles apart.\nThe plane's total flying distance between cities A and C is 100+150= <<100+150=250>>250 miles.\nThe distance between city C and city D is twice the distance between city B and city C, meaning city C and city D are 2*150 = <<300=300>>300 miles apart.\nThe plane flies a distance of 250+300 = <<250+300=540>>540 miles from city A to city D.\n#### 540",
