  "flawed_nl_solution": "The total monthly bill for 30 Mbps is $20 x 2= $<<20*2=40>>40.\nShe will have to pay $40 x 12 = $<<40*12=408>>408 every year for 30mbps.\nThe total monthly bill for 20 Mbps is $20 + $10= $<<20+10=30>>30.\nSo, she will have to pay $30 x 12 = $<<30*12=360>>360 for 20 Mbps per year.\nTherefore the amount she will save per year if she chooses the 20mbps is $408 - $360 = $<<408-360=48>>48\n#### 48",
