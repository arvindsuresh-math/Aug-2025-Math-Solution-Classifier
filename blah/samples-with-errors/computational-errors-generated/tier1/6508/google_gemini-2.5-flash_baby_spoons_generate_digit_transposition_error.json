  "flawed_nl_solution": "From the baby spoons, Lisa holds 4 children * 3 spoons each = <<4*3=21>>21 baby spoons.\nAdding this to the decorative spoons means Lisa has 21 baby spoons + 2 decorative spoons = <<21+2=23>>23 old spoons.\nIn the new set of cutlery, there is a total of 10 large spoons + 15 teaspoons = <<10+15=25>>25 new spoons.\nSo in total, Lisa has 23 old spoons + 25 new spoons = <<23+25=48>>48 spoons.\n#### 48",
