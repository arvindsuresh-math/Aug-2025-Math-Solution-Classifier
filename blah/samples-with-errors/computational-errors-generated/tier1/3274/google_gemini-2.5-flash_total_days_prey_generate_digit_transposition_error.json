  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total number of weeks the Bobbit worm preys on the fish: 2 weeks + 1 week = <<2+1=3>>3 weeks\nThen multiply that number by the number of days per week: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 12 days\nThen multiply that number by the number of fish the worm eats per day to find how many fish it eats total: 12 days * 2 fish/day = <<12*2=24>>24 fish\nThen add the number of fish James adds to the starting number of fish to find the ending number of fish: 60 fish + 8 fish = <<60+8=68>>68 fish\nThen subtract the number of eaten fish to find the number of surviving fish: 68 fish - 24 fish = <<68-24=44>>44 fish\n#### 44",
