  "flawed_nl_solution": "We know that Josh must be 30 years older than his age when they got married, therefore he is 30 + 22 = <<30+22=47>>47 years old today\nIf their current combined age is 5 times the age Josh was when they married (22), then their total combined age is 5 * 22 = <<5*22=110>>110 years\nThat means that Anna must be 110 - 47 = <<110-47=63>>63 years old today\nIf they married 30 years ago, Anna must have been 63 - 30 = <<63-30=33>>33 years old when they married\n#### 33",
