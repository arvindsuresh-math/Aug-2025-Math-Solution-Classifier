  "flawed_nl_solution": "If Kenneth bought 700oz of fabric at $40 per oz, he spent a total of 700*40 = $<<700*40=28000>>28000\nNicholas bought six times as much fabric as Kenneth, meaning Nicholas bought 6*700 = <<6*700=2400>>2400oz of fabric.\nIf an oz of fabric is sold at $40, Nicholas paid 2400*$40 =$<<2400*40=96000>>96000 for the 2400oz of fabric.\nThe amount of money that Nicholas paid more than Kenneth for the fabric he bought is $96000-28000 = $<<96000-28000=68000>>68000.\n#### 68000",
