  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=48>>48 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 48 mph = $<<2*48=96>>96\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $96 + $50 = $<<96+50=146>>146\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $146 * 2 = $<<146*2=292>>292\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $292 = $<<240+300+292=832>>832\n#### 832",
