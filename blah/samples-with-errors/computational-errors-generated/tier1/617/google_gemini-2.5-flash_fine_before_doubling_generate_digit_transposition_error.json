  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=45>>45 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 45 mph = $<<2*45=90>>90\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $90 + $50 = $<<90+50=104>>104\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $104 * 2 = $<<104*2=208>>208\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $208 = $<<240+300+208=748>>748\n#### 748",
