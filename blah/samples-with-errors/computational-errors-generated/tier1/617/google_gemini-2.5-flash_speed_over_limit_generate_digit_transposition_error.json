  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=54>>54 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 54 mph = $<<2*54=108>>108\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $108 + $50 = $<<108+50=158>>158\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $158 * 2 = $<<158*2=316>>316\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $316 = $<<240+300+316=856>>856\n#### 856",
