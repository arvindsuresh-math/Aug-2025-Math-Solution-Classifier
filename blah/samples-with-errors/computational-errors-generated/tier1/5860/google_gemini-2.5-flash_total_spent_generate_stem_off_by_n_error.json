  "flawed_nl_solution": "The corner light cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nEach brake disk costs $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.\nSo, the total price of the brake disks is $60x 2 = $<<60*2=120>>120.\nHe spent $10 + $20 + $120 = $<<10+20+120=160>>160 for the repair.\nTherefore, Robe has saved $480 + 160 = $<<480+160=640>>640 before his car broke.\n#### 640",
