  "flawed_nl_solution": "Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $<<40*4=160>>160 for the first 4 months.\nShe will pay a total of $35 x 4 = $<<35*4=410>>410 for the next 4 months.\nAnd she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the last 4 months.\nThus, she will pay a total of $100 + $160 + $410 + $120 = $<<100+160+410+120=790>>790 for 12 months including the down payment.\nTherefore, Loisa can save $790 - $450 = $<<790-450=340>>340 if she buys the tablet in cash.\n#### 340",
