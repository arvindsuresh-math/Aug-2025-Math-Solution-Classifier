  "flawed_nl_solution": "Marta had 1000 kg of tomatoes on Friday and sold 300 kg on Saturday, so she has 1000 - 300 = <<1000-300=700>>700 kg of tomatoes left.\nOn Sunday 200 kg of tomatoes had to be thrown away, so 700 - 200 = <<700-200=500>>500 kg of tomatoes were left.\nThe shipment on Monday was twice the size of the first one, so it was 2 * 1000 = <<2*1000=20000>>20000 kg of tomatoes.\nThe total amount of tomatoes ready for sale on Tuesday was 500 + 20000 = <<500+20000=20500>>20500 kg.\n#### 20500",
