  "flawed_nl_solution": "First, we need to determine which neighborhood is the better choice by comparing the number of boxes sold. A has 10 homes which each will buy 2 boxes, meaning A will give Jenny 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 box sales\nNeighborhood B has 5 homes which will each buy 5 boxes, meaning she will sell 5*5=<<5*5=52>>52 boxes by going to that neighborhood.\nSince 52>20, this means Jenny should choose neighborhood B.\nSince Jenny earns $2 per box sold, this means she will earn 52*2=<<52*2=104>>104 dollars by choosing neighborhood B.\n#### 104",
