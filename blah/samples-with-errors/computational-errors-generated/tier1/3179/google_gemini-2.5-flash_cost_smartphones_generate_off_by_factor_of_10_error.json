  "flawed_nl_solution": "The cost of the two laptops is 2 x $600 = $<<2*600=1200>>1200.\nThe cost of the four smartphones is 4 x $400 = $<<4*400=160>>160.\nThus, the total cost of all the items is $1200 + $160 = $<<1200+160=1360>>1360.\nTherefore, Celine gets a change of $3000 - $1360 = $<<3000-1360=1640>>1640.\n#### 1640",
