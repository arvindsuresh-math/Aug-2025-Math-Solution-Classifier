  "flawed_nl_solution": "It takes Lara 7 minutes and 23 seconds to make it through the obstacle course the first time. 7 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 420 seconds + 23 seconds = <<7*60+23=446>>446 seconds to get through the first part of the obstacle course.\nThe second stage of the obstacle course she completes in 73 seconds + 446 seconds = <<73+446=519>>519 seconds.\nIt takes 5 minutes and 58 seconds for Lara to get through the obstacle course the second time. 5 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 300 + 58 seconds = <<300+58=358>>358 seconds.\nCombined, it takes Lara 519 + 358 seconds = <<519+358=877>>877 seconds for Lara to run the whole obstacle course.\n#### 877",
