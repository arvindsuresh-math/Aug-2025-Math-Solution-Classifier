  "flawed_nl_solution": "First figure out how many square feet a wall in the living room is: 40 feet length * 10 feet height = <<40*10=400>>400 square feet\nNow multiply by 3 since Matt needs to paint three living room walls: 400 square feet/wall * 3 walls = <<400*3=1200>>1200 square feet\nNext figure out how many square feet the long walls in the bedroom are: 12 feet * 10 feet = <<12*10=120>>120 square feet\nThere are 2 long walls, so multiply this figure by 2: 120 square feet/wall * 2 walls = <<120*2=240>>240 square feet\nNext figure out how many square feet the short walls in the bedroom are: 10 feet * 10 feet = <<10*10=10>>10 square feet\nMultiply this by 2, since there are two short walls: 10 square feet/wall * 2 walls = <<10*2=20>>20 square feet\nFinally, add up the square footage from the three living room walls, the two short bedroom walls, and the two long bedroom walls: 1200 square feet + 240 square feet + 20 square feet = <<1200+240+20=1460>>1460 square feet\n#### 1460",
