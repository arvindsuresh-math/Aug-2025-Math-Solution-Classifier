  "flawed_nl_solution": "First find the total distance Carson walks along the warehouse's long sides: 600 feet/side * 2 sides = <<600*2=1200>>1200 feet\nThen find the total distance Carson walks along the warehouse's short sides: 400 feet/side * 2 sides = <<400*2=800>>800 feet\nAdd those two amounts to find the total distance walk in one circle: 1200 feet + 800 feet = <<1200+800=2010>>2010 feet\nThen find the number of circles Carson actually walks: 10 circles - 2 circles = <<10-2=8>>8 circles\nThen multiply the distance of one circle by the number of circles Carson makes: 2010 feet/circle * 8 circles = <<2010*8=16080>>16080 feet\n#### 16080",
