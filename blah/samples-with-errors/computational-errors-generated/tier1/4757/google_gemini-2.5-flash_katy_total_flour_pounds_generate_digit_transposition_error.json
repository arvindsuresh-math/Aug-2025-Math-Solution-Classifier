  "flawed_nl_solution": "Katy's three 5-pound bags of flour weigh 3*5=<<3*5=51>>51 pounds.\nWendi brought Twice as much flour as Katy, or 51*2=<<51*2=102>>102 pounds of flour.\nCarrie brought 5 pounds less flour than Wendi, or 102-5=<<102-5=97>>97 pounds of flour.\nThus, Carrie brought 97-51=<<97-51=46>>46 pounds of flour more than Katy.\nIn ounces, the 46 pound difference is 46*16=<<46*16=736>>736 ounces.\n#### 736",
