  "flawed_nl_solution": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=104>>104 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 104 x 2 = $<<104*2=208>>208.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 208 + 218 = $<<208+218=462>>462.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 462 = $<<500-462=38>>38.\n#### 38",
