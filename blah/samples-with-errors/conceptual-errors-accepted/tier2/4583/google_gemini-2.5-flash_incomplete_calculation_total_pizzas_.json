    "flawed_solution": "#### 29\nRuby was going to order 1 for her son, 1 for her daughter and 1 to share with her husband. So she needed to order 1+1 = <<1+1=2>>2 pizzas\nEach pizza cost $10 and she was ordering 2 so that comes to 10*2 = $<<10*2=20>>20\nShe needed to order pepperoni, sausage, black olive and mushroom, which came to 4 toppings at $1 each so 4*1 = $<<4*1=4>>4 extra for toppings\nThe pizzas cost $20 and $4 for the toppings so the total costs of the pizzas came to 20+4 = $<<20+4=24>>24\nShe also had to add a $5 tip to her current order total of $24 so 5+24 = $<<5+24=29>>29 for the total order"
