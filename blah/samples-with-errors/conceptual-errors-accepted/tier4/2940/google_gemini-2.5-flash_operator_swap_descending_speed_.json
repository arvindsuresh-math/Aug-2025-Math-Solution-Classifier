    "flawed_solution": "#### 7\nThe vehicle's speed decreases to 30 x 0.5 = <<30*0.5=15>>15 miles per hour when ascending to the top of the mountain.\nSo, the total time Crystal will have to spend going to the top of the mountain is 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 hours.\nAnd the speed of the vehicle increases by 30 x 0.2 = <<30*0.2=6>>6 miles per hour when going down to the foot of the mountain.\nSo, the total speed of the vehicle when going down is 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 miles per hour.\nThus, Chrystal will have to spend 72 / 24 = <<72/24=3>>3 hours to descend from the mountain.\nTherefore, the total hours she will spend to pass the whole mountain is 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 hours."
