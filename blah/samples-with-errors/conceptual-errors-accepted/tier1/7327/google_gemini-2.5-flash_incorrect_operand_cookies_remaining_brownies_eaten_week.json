    "flawed_solution": "#### 50\nFirst we find how many cookies Betty will eat in a week by multiplying her daily amount by 7, meaning 7*3=<<21=21>>21 cookies eaten in a week.\nWe repeat this for the brownies, finding she eats 7*1=<<7*1=7>>7 brownies in a week.\nWe subtract the 7 cookies from the original amount of 60, finding 60-7= <<60-7=53>>53 cookies remaining.\nWe repeat this step for the brownies, finding 10-7= <<10-7=3>>3 brownies remaining.\nIn the end, therefore, Betty has 53-3= <<53-3=50>>50 more cookies than brownies."
