    "flawed_solution": "#### 41\nHalf of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = <<5+6=11>>11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery  + 6 biographies = <<12+8+4+11+6=41>>41 books total"
