    "flawed_solution": "#### 270\nFor half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 1 candle each. Since half of the cupcakes is 24/2 and she plans to use 1 candle each for this half of the cupcakes, Stephanie needs (24/2)*1 = <<24/2*1=12>>12 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nFor the other half of the cupcakes, Stephanie wants to use 24 candles. Therefore, she will need (24/2)*24 =<<24/2*24=288>>288 candles for this half of the cupcakes.\nBecause Stephanie needs 12 candles for half of the cupcakes and 288 candles for the other half, she needs a total of 12+288=<<12+288=300>>300 candles.\nSince Stephanie needs 300 candles to decorate all the cupcakes and she currently has 30 candles, Stephanie needs 300-30= <<300-30=270>>270 additional candles."
