    "flawed_solution": "#### 16\nOne kilogram of tomatoes is 20/100 * 5 = $<<20/100*5=1>>1 cheaper than one kilogram of cucumbers.\nThis means that one kilogram of tomatoes costs 5 - 1 = $<<5-1=4>>4.\nSo two kilograms of tomatoes is a cost of 2 * 4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nAnd three kilograms of cucumbers is a cost of 3 + 5 = $<<3+5=8>>8.\nSo the price for both products would be 8 + 8 = $<<8+8=16>>16."
