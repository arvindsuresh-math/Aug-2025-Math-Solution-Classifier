      "Q: Hasan is packing up his apartment because he’s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers’ scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers’ scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n",
      "A: Let x be the number of plates removed from the box.\n",
      "Hasan figured out the movers' weight limit was 20 pounds. Since a pound is equal to 16 ounces, each box can hold 20 * 16, or <<20*16=320>>320 ounces.\n",
      "Each plate weighs 10 ounces, so the weight of the plates in the box after Hasan removes enough plates to satisfy the movers' weight limit is (38 - x) * 10 ounces\n",
      "Since these two values are equal, we can write the equation (38 - x) * 10 = 320.\n",
      "Dividing both sides by 10 leaves 38-x = 32.\n",
      "Adding x to both sides gives 38 – x + x = 32 +x, or, 38 = 32 +x\n",
      "Subtracting 32 from both sides gives the value of x, which is the number of plates removed from the box, 38 -32 = 32 + x – 32, or, 6 = x\n",

      "Q: A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?\n",
      "A: The mileage cost for the first apartment will be 31*20*0.58 = $<<31*20*0.58=359.60>>359.60\n",
      "This makes the total monthly cost of the first apartment 359.60 + 800 + 260 = $<<359.60+800+260=1419.60>>1419.60\n",
      "Similarly, the mileage cost for the second apartment will be 21*20*0.58 = $<<21*20*0.58=243.60>>243.60\n",
      "Thus, the total monthly cost of the second apartment is 243.60 + 900 + 200 = <<243.60+900+200=1343.60>>1343.60\n",
      "Therefore, the difference in total monthly costs is 1419.60 - 1343.60 = $<<1419.60-1343.60=76>>76\n",

Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?\n",
      "A: The curry house previously bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries = <<3*30=90>>90 peppers for very spicy curries.\n",

      "Q: Alec is running for Class President. He thinks that if he can get three-quarters of the class to vote for him then there is no chance anyone else can beat him. Half of the class have already said they will vote for him but out of the remaining students, only 5 have said they are thinking about voting for him. He surveys the students who are thinking about voting for someone else, and changes his flyers to reflect the issues these students are concerned about. This results in a fifth of these students saying they'll vote for him. If Alec's class has 60 students and everyone who said they will vote for him does so, how many more votes does Alec need to reach his goal number of votes?\n",
      "A: To calculate Alec's goal number of votes, we need to know that 60 students / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 students is equal to one-quarter of the class students.\n",
      "Alec's goal is therefore 15 students * 3 quarters = <<15*3=45>>45 votes.\n",
      "Half of the class said they will vote for him, so there are already 60 students / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 votes.\n",
      "Another 5 students are thinking about voting for him which leaves a total so far of 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 votes.\n",
      "This means there are 60 students - 35 voting for Alec = <<60-35=25>>25 students not voting for Alec.\n",
      "A fifth of these decided to vote, so this is a further 25 students / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5 votes.\n",
      "Alec is therefore receiving a total of 35 + 5 = <<35+5=40>>40 votes.\n",

He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber.  After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all.

      "A: First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = <<25*8=200>>200 hours\n",
