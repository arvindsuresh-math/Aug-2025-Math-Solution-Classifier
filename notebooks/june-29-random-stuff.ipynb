Assuming each employee receives the same wage, calculate the amount of money each employee is paid monthly.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "- Samantha, Aira, and Joe have 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 rubber bands altogether.\n",
      "- If we let x be the number of bands that Aira had, then Samantha had x + 5.\n",
      "- Since Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe, then Joe had x + 1.\n",
      "- Since the total number of bands is 18, then the equation is x + (x + 5) + (x + 1) = 18.\n",

      "- Let S be the length of the short side of the fence.\n",
