128,"A baker is making a large cake with three layers. Each layer is a cylinder with a height of 8 cm. The bottom layer has a radius of 20 cm, the middle layer has a radius of 15 cm, and the top layer has a radius of 10 cm. The baker needs to cover the exposed top and side surfaces of the stacked cake with frosting. What is the total surface area to be frosted in square centimeters? Use pi = 3.14.","The area to be frosted consists of the lateral (side) area of all three layers, plus the exposed top surfaces.
First, calculate the lateral area of each layer using the formula 2 * pi * r * h.
Lateral Area Bottom: 2 * 3.14 * 20 * 8 = 1004.8.
Lateral Area Middle: 2 * 3.14 * 15 * 8 = 753.6.
Lateral Area Top: 2 * 3.14 * 10 * 8 = 502.4.
Total lateral area: 1004.8 + 753.6 + 502.4 = 2260.8.
Next, calculate the exposed top area. This is the top of the smallest layer, plus the exposed rings of the larger layers. This simplifies to the total area of the largest circle (the top of the bottom layer).
Area of a circle is pi * r^2.
Exposed Top Area (Area of bottom layer's top): 3.14 * (20*20) = 1256.
Finally, calculate the total area to be frosted.
Total Frosted Area: 2260.8 (sides) + 1256 (top) = 3516.8.
The total surface area to be frosted is 3516.8 square cm.

129,"An author writes a book. The publisher pays a royalty of 10% on the first 10,000 copies sold and 15% on all copies sold thereafter. The book sells for $20. If 25,000 copies of the book are sold, what is the total royalty amount the author earns?","First, calculate the royalty earned from the first 10,000 copies.
Revenue from first 10k copies: 10000 * 20 = 200000.
Royalty from first 10k: 200000 * 0.10 = 20000.
Next, calculate the number of copies sold beyond the first 10,000.
Additional copies: 25000 - 10000 = 15000.
Calculate the royalty earned from these additional copies at the 15% rate.
Revenue from additional copies: 15000 * 20 = 300000.
Royalty from additional copies: 300000 * 0.15 = 45000.
Finally, calculate the total royalty earned.
Total royalty: 20000 + 45000 = 65000.
The author earns $65,000.
FINAL ANSWER: 65000"

131,"A science experiment requires a solution to be cooled from 80 degrees Celsius to -10 degrees Celsius. The cooling system can reduce the temperature by 4 degrees every minute. However, for the first 5 minutes, the cooling is only 50% effective due to system startup. How long does it take to reach the target temperature?","First, calculate the total temperature drop required.
Total drop: 80 - (-10) = 90.
A 90-degree drop is needed.
Calculate the cooling rate and temperature drop during the first 5 minutes.
Startup rate: 4 * 0.50 = 2.
The rate is 2 degrees per minute for the first 5 minutes.
Startup drop: 2 * 5 = 10.
The temperature drops by 10 degrees in the first 5 minutes.
Calculate the remaining temperature drop needed.
Remaining drop: 90 - 10 = 80.
Calculate the time needed to drop the remaining temperature at the full rate of 4 degrees/min.
Time at full rate: 80 / 4 = 20.
This takes another 20 minutes.
Calculate the total time taken.
Total time: 5 (startup) + 20 (full rate) = 25.
It takes 25 minutes.

132,"A company has a budget of $1,000,000 for a new project. 40% is allocated to research and development (R&D), 35% to manufacturing, and 15% to marketing. The remaining 10% is a contingency fund. During the project, R&D costs were 10% over budget, and manufacturing was 5% under budget. Marketing costs were exactly as budgeted. How much of the contingency fund was left?","First, calculate the budgeted and actual costs for the departments.
Budget R&D: 1000000 * 0.40 = 400000.
Actual R&D cost: 400000 * 1.10 = 440000.
R&D overage is $40,000.
Budget Manufacturing: 1000000 * 0.35 = 350000.
Actual Manufacturing cost: 350000 * 0.95 = 332500.
Manufacturing savings is $17,500.
Calculate the net overage from these departments.
Net overage: 40000 (R&D over) - 17500 (Mfg under) = 22500.
The project is $22,500 over budget so far.
This overage must be covered by the contingency fund.
Budgeted Contingency fund: 1000000 * 0.10 = 100000.
Calculate the remaining contingency fund.
Remaining contingency: 100000 - 22500 = 77500.
$77,500 was left in the contingency fund.

In the first year, the business makes a revenue of $150,000 and has expenses of $80,000. They decide to reinvest 40% of the profit back into the business and distribute the rest. How much money does Alex receive?","First, calculate the total profit for the first year.
Profit: 150000 - 80000 = 70000.
The profit is $70,000.
Calculate the amount of profit to be distributed.
Amount to reinvest: 70000 * 0.40 = 28000.
Distributed profit: 70000 - 28000 = 42000.
$42,000 will be distributed.
Next, calculate Alex's share of the profit based on his investment proportion.
Total investment: 30000 + 20000 = 50000.
Alex's investment share: 30000 / 50000 = 0.6.
Alex gets 60% of the distributed profit.
Alex's take: 42000 * 0.60 = 25200.
Alex receives $25,200.

134,"A rectangular park is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. A jogging path that is 2 meters wide is built around the inside edge of the park. The park's management decides to cover the path with a special rubber material that costs $40 per square meter. They also plant flowers along the outer edge of the path, which costs $10 per meter. What is the total cost for the material and the flowers?","First, calculate the cost of the rubber material for the path.
Area of the entire park: 120 * 80 = 9600.
Dimensions of the inner grassy area: (120 - 2*2) by (80 - 2*2), which is 116 by 76 meters.
Area of the inner grassy part: 116 * 76 = 8816.
Area of the path: 9600 - 8816 = 784.
The path is 784 square meters.
Material cost: 784 * 40 = 31360.
Next, calculate the cost of the flowers along the outer edge of the path.
The outer edge of the path is the perimeter of the park.
Perimeter: 2 * (120 + 80) = 400.
The perimeter is 400 meters.
Flower cost: 400 * 10 = 4000.
Finally, calculate the total cost.
Total Cost: 31360 + 4000 = 35360.
The total cost is $35,360.

135,"A bookstore buys a novel for $8. The selling price is set at a 75% markup. The store sells 200 copies at this price. Then, they put the book on sale at a 20% discount off the selling price and sell another 150 copies. Finally, they sell the remaining 50 copies on a clearance table at $9 per book. What was the total profit from selling all 400 books?","First, calculate the total cost of all 400 books.
Total Cost: 400 * 8 = 3200.
Next, calculate the revenue from the three selling phases.
Regular selling price (75% markup): 8 * 1.75 = 14.
Revenue from first 200 copies: 200 * 14 = 2800.
Sale price (20% off $14): 14 * 0.80 = 11.20.
Revenue from next 150 copies: 150 * 11.20 = 1680.
Revenue from final 50 copies at $9: 50 * 9 = 450.
Total Revenue: 2800 + 1680 + 450 = 4930.
Finally, calculate the total profit.
Total Profit: Total Revenue - Total Cost = 4930 - 3200 = 1730.
The total profit from selling all books is $1,730.
