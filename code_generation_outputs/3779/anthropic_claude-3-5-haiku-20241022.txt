Here's the solution following the specified guidelines:

```python
def solve(
        green_beads_per_repeat: int = 3,  # 3 green beads per repeat
        purple_beads_per_repeat: int = 5,  # 5 purple beads per repeat
        red_bead_multiplier: int = 2,  # twice as many red beads as green beads
        repeats_per_bracelet: int = 3,  # pattern repeats three times per bracelet
        repeats_per_necklace: int = 5,  # pattern repeats five times per necklace
        num_bracelets: int = 1,  # number of bracelets to make
        num_necklaces: int = 10  # number of necklaces to make
    ):
    """Code for Q 3779 from the GSM8K dataset (train).
    Returns the total number of beads needed for bracelets and necklaces."""
    
    # First find the number of red beads per repeat: 3 green * 2 red/green = <<3*2=6>>6 red
    red_beads_per_repeat = green_beads_per_repeat * red_bead_multiplier

    # Then add the number of beads of each color to find the total number of bead per repeat: 6 beads + 3 beads + 5 beads = <<6+3+5=14>>14 beads
    beads_per_repeat = red_beads_per_repeat + green_beads_per_repeat + purple_beads_per_repeat

    # Then multiply the number of beads per repeat by the number of repeats per bracelet to find the number of beads per bracelet: 14 beads/repeat * 3 repeats/bracelet = <<14*3=42>>42 beads/bracelet
    beads_per_bracelet = beads_per_repeat * repeats_per_bracelet

    # Then multiply the number of beads per repeat by the number of repeats per necklace to find the number of beads per necklace: 14 beads/repeat * 5 repeats/necklace = <<14*5=70>>70 beads/necklace
    beads_per_necklace = beads_per_repeat * repeats_per_necklace

    # Then multiply the number of beads per necklace by the number of necklaces to find the total number of beads used in the necklaces: 70 beads/necklace * 10 necklaces = <<70*10=700>>700 beads
    total_necklace_beads = beads_per_necklace * num_necklaces

    # Then add the number of beads used in a bracelet to the number of beads in the necklaces to find the total number of beads used: 700 beads + 42 beads = <<700+42=742>>742 beads
    total_beads = total_necklace_beads + (beads_per_bracelet * num_bracelets)

    # The final answer is the total number of beads
    return total_beads
