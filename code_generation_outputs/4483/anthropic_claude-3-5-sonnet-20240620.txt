Here's the Python function that formalizes the solution to the given problem:

```python
def solve(
    total_records: int = 200,  # Peggy has 200 records
    sammy_price: int = 4,  # Sammy will buy all of them for 4 dollars each
    bryan_interested_price: int = 6,  # Bryan will offer 6 dollars each for half the records
    bryan_uninterested_price: int = 1  # Bryan will offer 1 dollar each for the remaining half
):
    """Code for Q 4483 from the GSM8K dataset (train).
    Returns the difference in profit between Sammy's and Bryan's deals."""
    
    # Sammy is offering to take the whole collection of 200 records and pay Peggy 4 dollars each for them which would net Peggy 200 * 4=<<200*4=800>>800 dollars for her entire record collection.
    sammy_total = total_records * sammy_price
    
    # Half of Peggy's record collection is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100, which means that 100 records will sell for one price and 100 records will sell for another price.
    half_records = total_records // 2
    
    # Bryan is willing to pay more for the half of the record collection that he is interested in so Peggy would net 100 * 6=<<100*6=600>>600 dollars for the first half of her record collection.
    bryan_interested_total = half_records * bryan_interested_price
    
    # For the half of the collection that Bryan is just planning on reselling at a later date, he is willing to offer Peggy 100 *1=<<100*1=100>>100 dollars to take off of her hands.
    bryan_uninterested_total = half_records * bryan_uninterested_price
    
    # In total Bryan is willing to offer Peggy 600+100=<<600+100=700>>700 dollars for her entire record collection.
    bryan_total = bryan_interested_total + bryan_uninterested_total
    
    # If Sammy is offering 800 dollars to buy Peggy's entire record collection and Bryan is offering 700 dollars for Peggy's entire record collection, then Peggy's net profit would be 800-700=<<800-700=100>>100 dollars more by taking Sammy's deal instead of Bryan's deal.
    profit_difference = sammy_total - bryan_total
    
    # The final answer is the difference in profit between Sammy's and Bryan's deals
    return profit_difference
```

This function follows the given solution step by step, calculating the total offers from both Sammy and Bryan, and then returning the difference between these two offers as the final result.
