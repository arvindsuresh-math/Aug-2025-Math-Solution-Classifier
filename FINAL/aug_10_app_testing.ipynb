        "\n",
        "Overall, the pipeline is performing very well, with an accuracy of **(35 + 38 + 30) / 120 = 103 / 120 = 85.8%**. More importantly, the *types* of errors it makes are highly systematic and reveal clear insights into the behavior of each stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Stage 2 (Computational Check) is Near-Perfect\n",
        "The diagonal value for `Computational Error` is **38 out of 40**. This is an outstanding result. Your fine-tuned Gemma-3 model and the evaluation logic are extremely effective at their specific task. The two misclassifications were:\n",
        "*   **1 case predicted as `Correct`**: (Sample #10) A very complex multi-step problem where the computational error was subtle.\n",
        "*   **1 case predicted as `Conceptual`**: (Sample #7) The line `15:20, which simplifies to 3:5` contains no standard operators, so the computational check passed, and the conceptual model correctly identified it as flawed. This is reasonable behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. The PEMDAS Bug is the Main Cause of \"Correct -> Flawed\" Errors\n",
        "This is the most critical takeaway. The pipeline incorrectly classified 5 correct solutions.\n",
        "*   **3 were classified as `Computational Error`**: These are Samples #105, #108, and #110. As we diagnosed, this is **100% due to the PEMDAS bug** where the pipeline incorrectly evaluates expressions with parentheses. **Fixing the code will move these 3 samples into the \"Correct/Correct\" box.**\n",
        "*   **2 were classified as `Conceptual Error`**: These are Samples #85 and #99. These are false positives from the Phi-4 model. It appears to be overly cautious on very long, multi-step problems, even when they are logically sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. The Pipeline Hierarchy is Working as Designed\n",
        "This is the most interesting observation. The single largest source of error is the **8 cases** where a solution with a `True Label` of `Conceptual Error` was classified as a `Computational Error`.\n",
        "*   **Why this happens:** This is not a failure but a feature of your pipeline's design. In all 8 of these cases (e.g., Sample #42, #43, #53), the student's conceptual mistake led them to write a line that was *also* arithmetically incorrect.\n",
        "*   **Example:** In Sample #43, the conceptual error is adding `80 + 50`. The student then makes a computational error by writing `80 + 50 = 110`. Your pipeline correctly identifies the objective computational mistake (`80+50` is `130`, not `110`) and stops, reporting the most definitive error it found.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. The Conceptual Classifier is Good but Imperfect\n",
        "*   **False Negatives:** The classifier missed 2 conceptual errors and labeled them as `Correct` (Samples #41 and #64). These were subtle errors (using 6 days in a week, subtracting in the wrong order) that the model failed to catch.\n",
        "*   **Overall Performance:** Out of the 40 conceptual error cases, it correctly identified **38** of them as flawed in some way (30 as conceptual, 8 as computational). This is a strong result.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary & Actionable Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Your #1 Priority is Fixing the PEMDAS Bug:** This single code change will correct 3 out of the 5 errors made on `Correct` samples, instantly boosting your pipeline's accuracy and reliability.\n",
        "2.  **The Two-Stage Logic is Sound:** The pipeline is effectively using the fast conceptual check to filter solutions and the highly accurate computational check to find objective errors. The error hierarchy is behaving as expected.\n",
        "3.  **The Next Step for Improvement is Data:** To reduce the remaining errors (the 2 false positives and 2 false negatives from the conceptual model), the best path forward is to add these specific failure cases to the fine-tuning dataset for the Phi-4 classifier and retrain it."
