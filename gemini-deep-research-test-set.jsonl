{"question": "A snail crawls 5 cm every minute, but then rests for a minute, during which it slides back 2 cm. How many minutes will it take for the snail to be 16 cm away from its starting point for the first time?", "answer": "In a 2-minute cycle (crawl and rest), the snail makes a net progress.\nNet progress per 2 minutes = 5 cm - 2 cm = 3 cm.\nTo reach 15 cm, it will take 5 such cycles.\nTime to reach 15 cm = 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.\nAt 10 minutes, the snail is at 15 cm. In the next minute (the 11th minute), it crawls forward 5 cm.\nPosition at 11 minutes = 15 + 5 = 20 cm.\nSince 16 cm is passed during this 11th minute, we need to find the exact time.\nAfter 10 minutes, the snail is at 15 cm and needs to travel 1 more cm.\nTime to travel 1 cm = 1 cm / 5 cm/min = 0.2 minutes.\nTotal time = 10 minutes + 0.2 minutes = 10.2 minutes. But the question asks how many minutes it will take to be 16cm away. After 10 minutes, it is at 15cm. In the next minute it crawls 5cm. So at 11 minutes it is at 20cm. It passed 16cm during the 11th minute.\nLet's re-evaluate. After 8 minutes (4 cycles), the snail is at 4 * 3 = 12 cm.\nIn the 9th minute, it crawls 5 cm. Position = 12 + 5 = 17 cm.\nSo, it reaches and passes 16 cm during the 9th minute.\nFINAL ANSWER: 9"}
