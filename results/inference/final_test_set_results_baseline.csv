299,"A tech startup has an initial investment of $250,000. In the first year, their revenue is $180,000 and their operational costs are $120,000. They reinvest 60% of their first-year profit back into the company. In the second year, their revenue grows by 40% from the first year, and their operational costs increase to $150,000. At the end of the second year, what is the company's total cash reserve (initial investment + total profits after reinvestment)?","First-year profit: 180000 - 120000 = $60,000.
Amount reinvested from first-year profit: 60000 * 0.60 = $36,000.
Profit taken from first year: 60000 - 36000 = $34,000.
