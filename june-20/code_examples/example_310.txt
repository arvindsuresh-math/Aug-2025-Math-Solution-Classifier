*Question*: 
Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?

*Solution*: 
{'L1': 'First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = [[25*8=200]]200 hours', 'L2': 'Then calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15/hour = $[[200*15=3000]]3000', 'L3': 'Then multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $[[3000*4=12000]]12,000', 'L4': 'Now multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20/hour = $[[200*20=4000]]4,000', 'L5': "Now multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4,000/manager * 2 managers = $[[4000*2=8000]]8,000", 'L6': 'Now add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8,000 + $12,000 = $[[8000+12000=20000]]20,000', 'L7': 'Now multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $20,000 * .1 = $[[20000*.1=2000]]2,000', 'L8': 'Now add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $2,000 + $20,000 = $[[2000+20000=22000]]22,000'}
